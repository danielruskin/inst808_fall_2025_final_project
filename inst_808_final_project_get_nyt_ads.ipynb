As world leaders gather at the United\\n(Fy Nations to review our planet’s progress\\n\\nei on sustainable development, we expect\\nthey also will caucus on the issue of climate\\nchange. The reason: In just six months in Kyoto,\\nJapan, nations are poised to settle on a plan to\\nreduce greenhouse gases.\\n\\nIt began five years ago in Rio de Janiero,\\nwhen nations agreed to formulate a pian to reduce\\ngreenhouse gases. The concern is that the build-\\nup of these gases (carbon dioxide, methane and\\nnitrous oxide) in the atmosphere could cause\\nclimate change.\\n\\nThe agreement that will likely emerge from\\nthe Kyoto meeting will commit only industrialized\\nnations to binding targets and timetables to con-\\ntrol their emissions of greenhouse gases; other\\nnations may be asked to participate in this\\nprocess, but they are not bound to action.\\nEmission abatement pians have focused primar-\\nity on COs, which is produced when coal, oil and\\nnatural gas are burned. Much is at stake in these\\nupcoming global climate discussions —not just a\\nhabitable planet for future generations, but also a\\nworld where all nations can provide for the eco-\\nnomic well-being of their citizens.\\n\\nWe encourage governments to take the\\ntime to do it right—to examine the science,\\ndecide if emission levels are dangerous and then\\nevaluate steps to effectively mitigate or reduce\\nfuture emissions. If the wrong decision is made, it\\ncould be divisive — pitting industrialized countries\\n\\nagainst developing nations—and derail the seri- -\\n\\nous effort that may be needed to stabilize emis-\\nsion levels.\\n\\nA number of emission proposals have been\\ntabled. They deserve the attention of all govern-\\nment actors—not only environmental ministers,\\nbut also the economic and finance ministers.\\nAbatement measures need to be flexible so\\nnations can benefit from new technology and\\nimproved understanding of the science and eco-\\nnomics of climate change.\\n\\nInstead of rigid targets and timetables, gov-\\nernments should consider alternatives, including:\\n\\n@ Adopt consensus objectives; encourage\\nvoluntary initiatives and government-industry\\npartnerships that will help attain these goals.\\n\\nw Target all greenhouse gases, not just COz;\\nencourage development of sinks— activities that\\noffset or reduce these gases—like reforestation\\nand improved agricultural practices.\\n\\nm Encourage development and dispersion\\nof new technology to assure widespread adop-\\ntion of cost-effective abatement approaches.\\n\\nWhile the likely Kyoto agreement will directly\\naffect only industrialized nations, the burden will\\nultimately be borne by others. Many studies point\\nout that in a world where economies are increas-\\ningly integrated, energy exporters and developing\\nnations will suffer as well. As industrial economies\\nare driven to switch fuels and revamp their indus-\\ntrial bases, their growth will falter, altering trade\\npatterns throughout the world.\\n\\nA draft U.S. Department of Energy study on\\nsix energy-intensive industries indicates that high\\nenergy prices, which would follow from stiff com-\\nmitments to reduce CO, emissions, would have a\\ncrushing effect on these sectors. And despite the\\nblow to U.S. jobs and this industrial base, it is\\nunlikely that overall emissions would be reduced\\nbecause the manufacturing capacity would mi-\\ngrate to countries not bound by emission limits.\\n\\nCongress is also concerned. Sixty-one U.S.\\nsenators are calling for further review of the cli-\\nmate change issue. Since a binding agreement\\nsigned by the U.S. will require Senate ratifica-\\ntion, many legislators believe any emission re-\\nduction plan should include an estimate of its\\neconomic impact.\\n\\nClearly, curbing greenhouse gases is the\\nresponsibility of all nations. By early next century,\\nfast-growing, developing nations will be the largest\\ncarbon emitters. That’s why it is incumbent on all\\nnations to participate in the solution even in the\\nshort term.\\n\\nAs officials head home, we urge them to\\nreflect on the decisions that they will enter into\\nlater this year.

Take the promise of cleaner\\nair—a promise some states have used to\\nmandate the sale of electric vehicles (EVs).\\n\\nAccording to a recent U.S. General\\nAccounting Office (GAO) report, when the\\nimpact of electricity generation is included, new\\nEVs use more energy and generate more air pol-\\nlution than the average new gasoline-powered\\ncar. Other roadblocks to widespread use of EVs\\ninclude battery technology, cost, safety and\\nconvenience. Efforts to overcome these barriers\\nthe GAO noted, “are inherently risky and will\\nrequire substantial time, money and attention.”\\n\\nThe biggest push for EVs has come from\\nthe states, though federal support exists as\\nwell. Without waiting for evidence that EVs\\ncan deliver, California, Massachusetts and\\nNew York have mandated market shares for\\nEVs—2 percent of new car sales in 1998, ris-\\ning to 10 percent by 2003. Other states have\\nsaid they'll keep an EV option open.\\n\\nAfter nearly two years of research, the\\nGAO basically concluded EVs aren't ready.\\nNor are they likely to become so even in the\\nrosiest of scenarios. Here are some key findings:\\n\\n@ Battery technology just cannot com-\\npete with internal combustion engines today\\nor in the foreseeable future in terms of driving\\nrange, power and recharging capability, Today's\\ncommercially available EVs have a driving\\nrange of 30-50 miles under city driving condi-\\n\\ntions. Even advanced technology batteries\\nonly have a range of 80-100 miles.\\n\\nElectric vehicles are expensive—cost-\\ning two to three times more than conventional\\nautos. Even at mass production volumes, EVs\\nwith lead-based batteries are likely to be\\npriced 20 percent higher, while those using\\nmore advanced battery technologies will cost\\nsubstantially more.\\n\\nm EVs present some potential safety haz-\\nards. Some batteries use toxic, corrosive and\\nexplosive chemicals; some use higher voltage,\\nwhich poses a potentially lethal shock hazard.\\nBattery weight may affect a vehicle's maneu-\\nverability; and questions on their “crashworthi-\\nness” remain unanswered.\\n\\nf The environmental benefits of EVs are\\ndubious — particularly if one considers the\\nimpact of generating the required electricity,\\nwhich state regulators should be doing. If they\\ndid they'd know that when EVs are substi-\\ntuted for gasoline-powered autos, primary\\nenergy consumption increases by some 30\\npercent, greenhouse gas emissions rise by 5\\npercent and sulfur dioxide emissions climb\\nover 700 percent.\\n\\nIt's time to take another approach. Man-\\ndates won't make “promises” come true. And\\nputting EVs on the road before they can pro-\\nduce on those promises is the wrong thing to\\ndo to consumers and the nation’s clean air\\neffort. It's a price tag that gives no value for the\\nmoney we'll pay.\\n\\n \\n\\n© 1995 Mobil Corporation\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

A33\\n\\nThe Kyoto Protocol:\\nToo Many gaps\\n\\nLast December, many nations\\nnegotiated the Kyoto Protocol,\\n# which calls for 38 industrialized\\n\\na Fr countries to reduce their emis-\\naw sions of greenhouse gases. While\\nthis agreement certainly isn’t front-page news,\\nthe Protocol, its rules and implementing mech-\\nanisms are generating much discussion among\\ngovernments.\\n\\nThe Senate has voiced its opposition to the\\nProtocol. While Congress has held several cli-\\nmate change hearings, the Administration has\\nnot submitted the treaty to the Senate for ratifica-\\ntion. The next chapter opens in Buenos Aires\\nwhere momentum is building to move the\\nProtocol forward.\\n\\nWe have used this space previously to\\ndescribe the steps we are taking to address the\\npotential climate change issue. We also have\\nused these editorials to express our opposition to\\nthe Kyoto Protocol itself. We think we have a\\nresponsibility to participate in this debate because\\nwe as well as the American public have a stake in\\nthe outcome. Others in the business community\\nhave voiced their concerns.\\n\\nA new report by The Business Roundctable\\n(BRT) catalogs the problems created by the\\nKyoto Protocol, noting it “raises many more\\nquestions than it answers, and leaves too many\\ngaps unfilled... fails to address the global nature\\nof the issue...[and] we are still unable to assess\\nthe full economic ra.ufications of the Protocol:\\n\\nThe BRT is an association of 200 chiet\\nexecutive officers. This report reflects the thinking\\nof a broad spectru..: of business—from barking\\nand finance, insurance and publishing to heavy\\nindustry, telecommunications and chemicals.\\n\\nHere are highlights from “The Kyoto\\nProtocol: A Gap Analysis.”\\n\\n@ “The Protocol mandates an unprece-\\ndented 41 percent reduction of greenhouse gas\\nemissions by 2008-2012 for the United States\\nfrom the business-as-usual path.” The U.S.\\nEnergy Information Agency projects that U.S.\\nemissions will be 34 percent above 1990 levels\\nby 2010. “Thus, what may superficially seem to\\n\\n   \\n\\nbe a modest 7 percent reduction below 1990\\nlevels becomes, in real terms, a legal obligation\\nfor the U.S.” Put in perspective, “it is the equiva-\\nlent of having to eliminate ail current emissions’\\nfrom the transportation, utility or industry sector.” \\'\\nThis will require difficult choices for all Americans.\\n\\nm Developing countries are not covered by\\nthe Protocol. “Without full participation by devel-\\noping countries, the Kyoto Protocol will not\\nlead to a net reduction of global... emissions.”\\nDeveloping countries are becoming the largest\\nemitters and could account for more than half of -\\nall emissions by 2015.\\n\\n@ The Protocol uses “differentiated targets”\\nfor countries to meet, which potentially could put\\nthe U.S. at a disadvantage. “The variable targets .\\nweren\\'t necessarily based on criteria such as .\\ncountries’ growth, energy usage or levels of effi-\\nciency....” The European Union, for example, is”\\nmuch closer to its target than it might seem |\\nbecause those economies were robust in 1990 ,\\nand energy efficiency (particularly in East .\\nGermany) was poor. Since then, their economies -\\nhave weakened and the U.K. has converted from\\ncoal to natural gas. Moreover, the EU nations will\\nbe able to pool their emissions and report as a.\\nsingle entity for compliance purposes. “As a\\nresult, some countries will be able to continue to\\nincrease their emissions.”\\n\\n@ “The establishment of a 1990 emissions\\n‘baseline’ disproportionately affects the United\\nStates.\" That was a recession year for our econ-\\nomy. Subsequent economic growth contributed\\nto an increase in emission levels. Now, America\\nis being penalized for “... having strong economic\\ngrowth since 1990, after the arbitrarily esteb-\\nlisned baseline.”\\n\\nf& And finally, the report notes that Kyoto is\\nsilent on the crucial issues of compliance and \\'\\nenforcement.\\n\\nWhile tne BRT opposes the Protocol, it\\npledges to work with the U.S. government and\\nothers to ensiire a healthy economy and environ-\\nment.

There is no longer a\\nneed for alarmists; but there is aneed for some\\nperspective and some optimism. There’s a lot\\nof good news out there.\\n\\nGregg Easterbrook has given us that per-\\nspective in his recent book, “A Moment on the\\nEarth: The Coming Age of Environmental Opti-\\nmism” (Viking Penguin, 1995). Easterbrook talks\\nabout the dire predictions of the 1960s and\\n1970s that did not come to pass, sheds light on\\nthe tenacity of the Earth and discusses how\\nmuch good has already occurred, while not\\ndiminishing the work that remains to be done.\\n\\nThe robin, which some believed would be\\nextinct by now, is still one of the most prolific\\nbirds in the United States. The 1980s saw not\\nwidespread starvation as some had forecast,\\nbut an agricultural abundance. The supply of\\npetroleum that some said would be exhausted\\nby the 1990s is stil! ample.\\n\\nAs Easterbrook points out, air in the U.S.\\nis significantly cleaner in the '90s than it was in\\nthe '70s. Smog in the U.S. declined even as\\nthe economy grew and the number of cars on\\n\\n \\n\\nis not falling\\n\\nthe road increased. Air pollution from tead\\ndeclined by more than 90 percent, and emis-\\nsions that form smog and acid rain declined\\nsubstantially. The number of cities that do not\\nmeet national ambient air-quality standards has\\ndeclined by 50 percent since the mid-’70s. This\\niS progress.\\n\\n‘ And to those who think industry and\\nnature cannot coexist, we say show a little\\nrespect for Mother Nature. She is one strong\\nlady, resilient and capable of rejuvenation. The\\nenvironment recovers well from both natural\\nand man-made disasters.\\n\\nWhen Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980,\\nit destroyed 200 square miles of land and 19\\nmillion old-growth trees. Just 15 years later,\\nmuch of the area has recovered. New genera-\\ntions of elk have learned to feed in new-growth\\nforests rather than old growth. Coho salmon,\\nthought unable to survive in the now unnatu-\\nrally warm waters of the area, are thriving. Even\\nAlaska’s Prince William Sound survived a 1989\\noil spill and today is biologically alive thanks to\\nthe remarkable powers of nature.\\n\\nIn his book, Easterbrook points out nature\\nitself has produced far more devastating changes\\nthan any caused by man—ice ages, meteor\\nstrikes, large-scale volcanic eruptions that\\nspewed millions of tons of “pollutants” into the\\nair—and the environment has survived.\\n\\nDoes this justify or lessen the impact of\\nindustrial pollution? Of course not. Our point is —\\nthat nature, over the millennia, has learned to\\ncope. Mother Nature is pretty successful in tak-\\ning on human nature.\\n\\nThere are pienty of legitimate environmen-\\ntal problems yet to be tackled.

But this\\nking of the road could be challenged by diesel-\\npowered vehicles. A renewed focus on more\\nefficient family transportation is fueling this race.\\nIn the jate 1970s, concern over gasoline\\nsupplies and prices prompted some American\\nmotorists to travel down the diesel engine path.\\nFor most, though, this was a short-lived detour.\\nNot so in Europe where diesel-powered\\nautos now enjoy a substantial market share.\\nThe reason: government policies—namely,\\nhigh gasoline taxes—have encouraged their\\npurchase and use.\\n\\nMotorists with long memories will recall\\nthat the early diesel-powered cars were noisy\\nand slow to accelerate, and had starting prob-\\nlems in cold weather. Add diesel’s exhaust\\nfumes and the difficulty drivers had finding ser-\\nvice stations with diesel pumps and it’s no\\nwonder these cars never seriously threatened\\nthe popular gasoline-powered cars.\\n\\nBut that was yesterday. Today, virtually all\\nthe performance problems are being solved, so\\nthe diesel could become a viable player, provid-\\ning motorists with a clean, efficient option.\\n\\nOverall, the diesel is 30 percent to\\nAO percent more fuel efficient than a gasoline-\\npowered car. That improves the driving range\\nfor motorists while reducing their costs. It also\\nhelps automakers who must meet the govern-\\nment's Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency\\n(CAFE) goals. And, burning less fuel means\\nemitting less carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas\\nwhich could contribute to climate change.\\n\\nDiesel-powered autos, though, create\\nemissions challenges. The automotive and\\noil industries developed highly sophisticated\\n\\n \\n\\ntechnologies over 30 years to reduce tailpipe\\nemissions from gasoline engines. The diesel\\nsystem, though, is behind the curve. Emission\\ntechnology for the diesel needs time to catch\\nup to overcome these hurdles.\\n\\nThe evolution of a new family vehicle is a\\nprocess too big for any one company, or any\\none industry, to guide. It did get a jump start\\nseveral years ago with the formation of a\\ngovernment/auto industry program called\\nPartnership for a New Generation of Vehicles.\\nOne of its goals is to develop by 2004 a proto-\\ntype of an affordable family vehicle that gets up\\nto 80 miles to a gallon.\\n\\nThat partnership spawned various indus-\\ntry alliances that have produced a number of\\npromising solutions. Commercializing them\\nremains the next step. Today's advanced diesel\\nengine is one such practical step.\\n\\nBut work remains to be done on diesel’s\\nemissions. That’s an area where Mobil and\\nFord are partnering to develop the fuel, engine\\nand after-treatment technologies that the diesel\\nsystem will need to achieve both its efficiency\\nand emission targets.\\n\\nDeveloping tomorrow's affordable,\\ncleaner and more efficient family vehicles is\\na balancing act. Conflicting demands from\\nthe U.S. government don’t help. While the\\nTransportation and Energy departments\\nare pressing for the fuel-economy benefits\\nthat diesel can provide, the Environmental\\nProtection Agency has proposed aggressive\\nemission targets for 2004 for light-duty diesel-\\npowered vehicles.\\n\\nNone of the doors to tomorrow's vehicles\\nshould be closed prematurely. Regardless of\\nwhich engine-and-fuel combination emerges\\nas the best, the motorist should be the real\\nking of the road.\\n\\naE\\nMobil The energy\\n\\nwww. mobil om\\n\\nto make a difference.\\n\\n©1999 Mot Corporation\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

This buiids on our program :\\nlast year that helped American Forests plant -\\nhalf a million trees in Florida, Virginia and\\n\\nWisconsin. , ; ‘\\n\\nThe Nature Conservancy will use a Mobil\\ngrant for the development phase of the\\n“Central Seiva Climate Action” project in Peru. '\\nThis is a multipronged attempt to preserve the\\narea’s rich diversity of plant and animal life,\\ngenerate greenhouse-gas benefits and con-\\ntribute to the sustainable development of the’\\nindigenous community. Our support will be\\nused to focus on forest protection and man-\\nagement as a way to mitigate greenhouse-gas\\nemissions. It will be conducted in partnership\\nwith ProNaturaleza, a Peruvian environmental\\norganization.

However, weather and climate\\nare not the same — climate is far more com-\\nplex.\\n\\nWhile we all know what weather is, most\\nOf us are less clear about climate. A region's cli-\\nmate is defined as the prevailing behavior of its\\nweather, including variability.\\nSeveral decades of weather\\nmust ordinarily be con-\\nsidered to establish the\\naverage conditions and vari-\\nability of climate.\\n\\nThus, the recent re-\\ncord cold weather in the\\nNortheast U.S. does not indicate a cooling cli-\\nTate, just as last year's record summer heat in\\nEurope does not confirm a warming world.\\n\\nGeological evidence indicates that\\nEarth’s climate hds varied continuously, warm-\\ning and cooling due to changes on and beyond\\nEarth. Factors as diverse as variations in sun-\\nlight and Earth's magnetic field, asteroid im-\\npacts, Sun-Moon-Earth orbital interactions,\\ncosmic ray fluxes, continental drift, fluctuations\\nin $ea level, volcanic eruptions, changes in the\\nbiosphere, and massive ebbs and flows of con-\\ntinental glaciers, have significantly influenced\\nclimate.\\n\\n \\n\\nChanges in one feature can affect others.\\nDuring recent ice ages, another factor, green-\\nhouse gas concentrations, changed for rea-\\nSons that remain unclear. Evidence suggests\\nthat shifts in the flow of dust and nutrients from\\nlands to oceans may have significantly altered\\nthe exchange of carbon dioxide between\\n\\n \\n\\nChanges in one\\nfeature can affect\\nothers the\\n\\nthe air and oceans.\\n\\nObservations and theory both indicate\\nthat weather and important aspects of climate,\\nfor instance E! Nino events, behave in a chaotic\\nfashion that may never allow for definitive, long-\\nterm predictions. These and other fluctuations\\n\\n- Produce significant natural climate variability,\\n\\nFor example, over the past thousand years his-\\ntorical accounts and scientific data show evi-\\ndence of a Medieval Warm\\nPeriod followed by a Little\\nIce Age.\\n\\nin the face of natural\\nvariability and complexity,\\nconsequences of\\nchange in any single factor,\\nfor exampie greenhouse\\ngases, cannot readily be isolated and predic-\\ntion becomes difficult. Geological and historical\\nrecords make clear the need to account for\\nnatural climate variability and the integrated re-\\nsponse of the sntire climate system.\\n\\nOver the last few decades climate re-\\nsearch has made great progress. !n particular,\\nresearch has highlighted the risks to society\\nand ecosystems resulting from the buildup of\\ngreenhouse gases. At the same time, scientific\\nuncertainties continue to limit our ability to\\nMake objective, quantitative determinations re-\\ngarding the human role in recent climate\\nchange or the degree and consequences of fu-\\nture change.\\n\\nThis reinforces the view that, as countries\\nand societies work to find acceptable ap-\\nproaches to address climate change while con-\\ntinuing to promote global prosperity, there is an\\nongoing need to support scientific research to\\ninform decisions and guide policies.\\n\\nExxonMobil\\n\\nTaking on the world’s toughest energy challenges?\\n\\nVisit exxenmobi.com\\n\\n4. *\\n\\n4\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The amount of carbon\\ndioxide in the atmosphere has risen in the last 100\\nyears, leading scientists to conclude that the\\nincrease is a result of man-made activities.\\n\\nAlthough the linkage between the green-\\nhouse gases and global warming is one factor,\\nother variables could be much more important\\nin the climate system than emissions produced\\nby man.\\n\\nThe UN-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel\\non Climate Change (IPCC) thought it had found\\nthe magic bullet when it concluded that the one-\\ndegree Fahrenheit rise in global temperatures Over\\n\\n     \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n \\n\\nCarbon Dioxide Emissions\\n\\nHuman Activities 3%-4% _\\n\\nthe past century may bear a “fingerprint” of\\nhuman activity.

By contrast, climate in the 10,000\\nyears since the last lce Age has been assumed\\nto be quite stable and serene, an assumption\\nthat is crumbling in the face of ever more sophis-\\nticated measurements. It now appears that the\\nclimate in this period has actually been quite\\nvolatile, changing Earth in ways that may dwarf\\nthe impact of human activity and complicate pre-\\ndicting climate trends. Nevertheless, the human\\nfactor in global climate change and the chance\\nthat we might be headed for damaging social\\nand economic dislocations cannot be ignored. In\\nthe second of three reports on global climate\\nchange, we look at efforts to achieve an ecologi-\\ncal balance.\\n\\nThe evolving science of climate change and\\nthe known behavior of greenhouse gases in the\\natmosphere—their long life and global, cumnula-\\ntive buildup—argue for a careful and comprehen-\\nsive approach to their control. Unfortunately,\\npolicy decisions now being considered in United\\nNations climate change negotiations could lead\\nto premature, inequitable and ultimately counter-\\nproductive measures. At stake are trillions of dol-\\nlars in technological and industrial changes,\\npotentially disruptive trade wars and an unprece-\\ndented transfer of weaith.\\n\\nA critical factor is timing. The compressed\\ntimetable of these negotiations tends to create an\\nunwarranted sense of crisis. A gradual approach\\n—one that would not result in an appreciable\\nbuildup of gases over the next 100 years—would\\nallow us to improve our understanding of the\\npotential threat and to develop more efficient\\ntechnology to deal with it. The U.N. Framework\\nConvention on Climate Change itself recognizes\\nthe dynamic nature of greenhouse-gas decision-\\nmaking. It requires periodic review “in tight of the\\nbest available scientific information on climate\\nchange and its impacts, as well as relevant tech-\\n\\nVith climate change,\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nnical, social and economic information.” .\\n\\nThere is great pressure to assign responsi-\\nbility for the stabilization and reduction of emis-\\nsions, along with the cost, almost entirely to the\\nindustrialized world. While the developing world\\nwould be spared the initial burden, such selective\\ncontrols would penalize all nations in the long run.\\n\\nimposing controls only on the industrialized\\nworld would likely cause what economists call “car-\\nbon leakage”—the transfer of energy-intensive\\nindustries to less-regulated countries, where they\\nwould offset the benefits of emission reductions.\\nBeyond this, the cost of mitigation, even for the\\nwealthiest nations, would weaken their purchasing\\npower and lead to a reduction in imports from the\\ndeveloping countries depriving them of a pow-\\nerful impetus for growth and prosperity.\\n\\nThe U.N. climate control negotiations rely\\non an arbitrary classification of countries as either\\ndeveloped or emerging. While much of the world\\nfalls short of a decent standard of living—nearly\\n2 billion people have never seen a light bulb,\\nand half of them rely on wood or other biomass\\nfor fuel—the developing world as now defined\\nincludes a growing list of commercial power-\\nhouses. Among developed countries, patterns of\\nenergy use are so diverse that an equal percent-\\nage reduction in emissions by all would be both\\nunfair and uneconomical.\\n\\nindependent studies—by the Australian\\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade as well\\nas the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\n(MIT) — increasingly point to international cooper-\\nation and worldwide implementation of control\\nmeasures as sensible and cost-effective. Such\\nan approach would include funding and technol-\\nogy for emission controls to flow from developed\\ncountries to the rest of the world, in return for\\ncredits for their own mitigation measures.

It also promised to evaluate\\nthe economics of that policy and measure its\\nimpact. Those resuits are important because the\\nproposals submitted by other countries thus\\nfar would be disruptive and costly to the U.S.\\neconomy.\\n\\nYet, when the results from its own eco-\\nnomic models were finally generated, the admin-\\nistration started distancing itself from the findings\\nand models that produced them. The administra-\\ntion’s top economic advisor said that economic\\nmodels can’t provide a “definitive answer” on the\\nimpact of controlling emissions. The effort, she\\nsaid, was “futile.” At best, the models can only\\nprovide a “range of potential impacts.”\\n\\nFrankly, we're puzzled. The White House\\nhas promised to lay the economic facts before\\nthe public. Yet, the administration's top advisor\\nsaid such an analysis won’t be based on models\\nand it will “preclude...detailed numbers.” If you\\ndon't provide numbers and don't rely on models,\\nwhat kind of rigorous economic examination can\\nCongress and the public expect?\\n\\nWe're also puzzied by ambivalence over\\nmodels. The administration downplays the utility\\nof economic models to forecast cost impacts\\n10-15 years from now, yet its negotiators accept\\nas gospel the 50-—100-year predictions of giobal\\nwarming that have been generated by climate\\nmodels—many of which have been criticized as\\nseriously flawed.\\n\\nThe second study, conducted by Argonne\\nNational Laboratory under a contract with\\nthe Energy Department, examined what would\\n\\n \\n\\nhappen if the U.S. had to commit to higher\\nenergy prices under the emission reduction\\n\\nplans that several nations had advanced last\\n\\nyear. Such increases, the report concluded,\\nwould result in “significant reductions in output\\nand employment” in six industries—aluminum,\\ncement, chemical, paper and pulp, petroteum\\nrefining and steel.\\n\\nHit hardest, the study noted, would be the\\nchemical industry, with estimates that up to 30\\npercent of U.S. chemical manufacturing capacity\\nwould move offshore to developing countries.\\nJob losses could amount to some 200,000 in\\nthat industry, with another 100,000 in the steel\\nsector. And despite the substantial loss of U.S.\\n\\njobs and manufacturing capacity, the net emis- -\\n\\nsion reduction could be insignificant since de-\\nveloping countries will not be bound by the\\nemission targets of a global warming treaty.\\n\\nDownplaying Argonne’s findings, the’\\n\\nEnergy Department noted that the study used\\noutdated energy prices (mid-1996), didn't reflect\\nthe gains that would come from international\\nemissions trading and failed to factor in the\\nbenefits of accelerated developments in energy\\nefficiency and low-carbon technologies.\\n\\nWhat it failed to mention is just what these\\nnew technologies are and when we can expect\\ntheir benefits to kick in. As far emissions trading,\\nmany economists have theorized about the role\\nthey could play in reducing emissions, but few\\nhave grappled with the practicality of implement-\\ning and policing such a scheme.\\n\\nWe applaud the goals the U.S. wants to\\nachieve in these upcoming negotiations—namely,\\nthat a final agreement must be “flexible, cost-\\neffective, realistic, achievable and ultimately\\nglobal in scope.” But until we see the details of\\nthe administration's policy, we are concerned that\\nplans are being developed in the absence of\\nrigorous economic analysis.

Today, we respectfully\\nsubmit our message to the officials who are\\ngathered in Kyoto to consider actions to\\nreduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other\\ngreenhouse gases.\\n\\nMobil shares the widespread concern\\nabout the potential impact of these emissions\\non the global climate. At the same time, we are\\nconcerned that mandated emission cutbacks\\nnow will produce grave economic conse-\\nquences for all nations.\\n\\nFossil fuels dominate the world’s energy\\npicture today. For at least several decades, they\\nwill continue to be the major source of the\\nworld’s energy needs. Government and the pri-\\nvate sector should begin now to expand the\\narray of technology options that can help reduce\\nour emission of greenhouse gases in the future.\\n\\nThe mission of the delegates at the Kyoto\\nconference should not be driven by the politics\\nof an artificial deadline, nor should it be con-\\nstrained by only the several proposals under\\nconsideration.\\n\\nTwo factors argue for nations to move\\nprudently. First, there is a high degree of\\nuncertainty over the timing and magnitude of\\nthe potential impacts that man-made emissions\\nof greennouse gases have on climate. Second,\\nthe emission-reduction policies being con-\\nsidered carry with them very large economic\\nrisks. Objectives and actions to deal with\\nclimate change can only be determined as\\nadditional knowledge is gained and uncertain-\\nties minimized. Nations should commit them-\\nselves to meaningful actions, including:\\n\\n  \\n\\nwhile harnessing free markets and voluntary\\nmeasures to deliver optimum emission reduc-\\ntions while preserving sustained economic\\ngrowth.\\nw To address the scientific uncertainty, govern-\\nments, universities and industry should form\\nglobal research partnerships to fill in the Knowl-\\nedge gap, with the goal of achieving a consen-\\nsus view on critical issues within a defined time\\nframe.\\nw During the fact-finding period, governments\\nshould encourage and promote voluntary\\nactions by industry and citizens that reduce\\nemissions and use energy wisely. Govern-\\nments can do much to raise public awareness\\nof the importance of energy conservation.\\nMobil is already participating in such\\nefforts. Through cooperative endeavors, we are\\nfunding research on technologies that promise\\ngreater energy savings or lower greenhouse\\ngas emissions. We are continuing to create\\nenergy-saving products, reducing our own\\nemissions and undertaking forestation projects\\nto remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\\nIn proposing these recommendations,\\nwe ask the Kyoto delegates to avoid mandates\\nbased on uncertain science and to resist\\nagreements that could inflict great economic\\npain. Take steps to curtail emissions, develop\\nmore energy-efficient technologies and im-\\nprove scientific understanding: These are the\\nchallenges nations should lay before their citi-\\nzens. Collectively, we can accomplish a lot.\\nThe Kyoto delegates should know that\\nthere is time to make it right. Advances in cli-\\nmate science can remove a degree of uncer-\\ntainty from decisions on how best to protect\\nour planet and its inhabitants.\\n\\nan\\nVObil The energy\\n\\nhttp:/Awww.mobil.com/climatechange\\n\\nto make a difference.\\n\\n©1997 Mobil Corporatan\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

One such issue is climate\\nchange.\\n\\nMobil is concerned about the potential\\nfor human activities to affect climate. That\\'s\\nwhy we support voiuntary efforts to reduce\\nemissions. The Kyoto Protocol has been billed\\nas a solution. It isn\\'t the right one. It only\\nfocuses on emissions in developed countries,\\nwill only minimally reduce the amount of green-\\nhouse gases in the atmosphere and will pro-\\nduce major economic distortions in the U.S.\\nand elsewhere.\\n\\nCredible private-sector studies have de-\\ntailed Kyoto’s potential economic effects. And\\nnow, a U.S. government report provides fur-\\nther evidence of what to expect.\\n\\nEarlier this year, analyses by WEFA, Inc.,\\nand Standard & Poor’s DRI concluded that\\nthe only way the U.S. could meet the Kyoto-\\nmandated emissions target is to significantly\\nincrease energy prices, force conservation\\nand promote fuel switching—all at consider-\\nable cost. /\\n\\nWEFA estimates the cost of achieving the\\nKyoto target by 2010 would result in a loss of\\n2.4 million jobs, a doubling of electricity prices\\nand an annual loss in economic output of $300\\nbillion—an amount greater than our nation\\'s\\nexpenditures for primary and secondary edu-\\ncation. Ditto DRI’s conclusions: job losses of\\nmore than one million, an increase in electricity\\nprices of nearly 40 percent and a decline in\\nGDP of roughly $100 billion.\\n\\nNow the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s\\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA) re-\\nports the mandated emissions cap could\\ncost the U.S. far more than the Administration\\n\\nestimates. EIA examined six emission re-\\n\\nmag\\n\\nsat\\n\\nwMy\\n\\naleyy\\nmaul\\netl\\n\\nduction scenarios and concluded that as 7\"\\n\\nhigher energy costs work their way through the |\\n\\neconomy, the annual loss in GDP could range\\n\\nfrom $150 billion to $400 billion. That trans- .\\nlates to an annual cost of $1,500 to $4,000 .«:\\n\\nper family.\\n\\nThe Administration’s Council of Eco- \"|\\n\\nnomic Advisors (CEA) estimates the annual\\nGDP penalty at $7 billion—$12 billion, or a cost\\nper household of $70-$110. Why this rosy pic-\\nture? Because the CEA is counting on the U.S.\\n\\nbeing able to meet most of its target by relying ¢ .\\n\\non a global emissions trading system. Yet, the\\n\\nKyoto Protocol limits emissions trading to the -\\n\\ndeveloped countries.\\n\\nWhile emerging economies probably offer\\nopportunities to reduce emissions at lower\\ncosts than in the U.S., some nations like China\\nand India have said they are unwilling to par-\\nticipate in such schemes.\\n\\nJust 15 months ago, the U.S. Senate\\nvoiced its concerns over ratifying a treaty that\\nwould cause serious harm to the U.S. econ-\\nomy or that did not include participation by\\ndeveloping nations. Those concerns still have\\nnot been satisfied.\\n\\nThis week, negotiators are meeting in\\nBuenos Aires to discuss the complex rules to\\nimplement the Kyoto Agreement. Emissions\\ntrading is certain to be on the agenda. Serious\\ndifferences already exist on the percentage of\\nreductions that should come from domestic\\nactions rather than trading. The U.S. would\\nargue for no restrictions; the European Union\\nwants at least 50 percent of the reductions to\\ncome from domestic steps.\\n\\nWhile complex mechanics continue to be\\nworked, the fatal flaws of the Protocol—man-\\ndated emissions targets, selective participation\\nand economic distorntions—still persist.\\n\\nan\\nMobil The energy\\n\\nnitp //wwwy.mobil.com “\\n\\nto make a difference.\\n\\n« YOM Motor Corporation *\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Does it not\\nstrike anyone as curious that you can get an\\nenvironmental vote on legislation dealing with\\nglobal warming and then flip-flop to the other\\nside of the issue and get another gold star for\\nsupporting moratoria to put the gas reserves\\nof this country out of reach?\\n\\n“In the North Atlantic planning area, we\\nare talking about over 2.54 trillion cubic feet of\\nnatural gas. Thatis the equivalent of over 450\\nmillion barrels of oil. But no—let us not develop\\nthe gas. Let us simply import the oil in tankers\\nthat ply the coast of Maine, Massachusetts,\\nConnecticut, Rhode Island, and New York.\\nBesides, when there is a tanker spill, we can\\nall blame the administration for its recovery\\nresponse. .\\n\\n“We already have a’ moratorium in this\\nlegislation off New Jersey. The mid-Atlantic\\nplanning area has an estimate of 5.35 trillion\\ncubic feet of natural gas. That is over 950 mil-\\nlion barrels of oil equivalent. But many who\\ngive speeches on global warming do not want\\nus to develop the natural gas reserves off\\ntheir shores which could mitigate the effects\\n\\nof global warming....\\n\\n“And to my friends who want to buy\\nback producing leases off the coast of Flor-\\nida, | would ask, ‘Where do we get the petro-\\nchemical feedstocks to manufacture those\\never-popular mouse ears?’\\n\\n“Mr. President, at some point there has\\nto be an end to the environmental game of\\npolitical gamesmanship. if we are ever to get\\nserious about our energy dependency and\\nour legitimate environmental concerns, then\\nwe need to look to our natural gas reserves.\\nSenators simply cannot come to the floor and\\ndemand that we convert the federal fleet to\\nnatural gas and at the same time oppose\\nonshore and offshore production of natural gas.\\n\\n“At some point the so-called environ-\\nmental community has to come forward with\\nsomething positive. They hate hydro, they\\ndespise OCS, they get apoplectic over\\nANWR, they denounce coal, and they\\nbecome catatonic about nuclear. They are\\nappalled that we could wind up in a war in the\\nMideast which they made almost inescap-\\nable. All you need do is look around the Cham-\\nber and count the votes.\\n\\n“Think of the hypocrisy. Some of my col-\\nleagues argue against offshore drilling\\nbecause they believe offshore drilling is more\\ndangerous than onshore drilling and because\\na majority of the voters in their states don't\\nwant it. :\\n\\n“Yet in November, many of these same\\ncolleagues voted against cloture on S.1220\\nbecause of ANWR, which was onshore and\\nhad the support of a majority of the citizens of\\nAlaska.\\n\\n“Against the war, against OCS, against\\nANWR, against nuclear, against hydro.

The book\\ndocuments how some of the myths of the\\n1960s and 1970s—and some much older\\nthan that— are being perpetuated and taught\\nas gospel truth in some of our schools. And\\nthe book raises a question in our minds: Will\\nthe next generation have any better under-\\nstanding of science and technology—both\\ntheir merits and their problems—than our\\nown?\\n\\nProfessor London's book is not a plea for\\nunbridled technology. But it is a plea for\\nbalance. And school textbooks, he believes,\\nare notoriously unbalanced. In dealing with\\nenvironmental questions, for example, no\\ntextbook the professor could find made any\\nmention of the following facts:\\n\\n@ Total automobile emissions of hydrocar-\\nbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide\\n\\nin the U.S. are less than half what they were\\nfrom 1957 to 1967. .\\n\\n@ The amount of unhealthy sulfur dioxide\\nin the air has been steadily declining since\\n1970.\\n\\nThe bacteria level in the Hudson River\\ndeclined by more than 30 percent between\\n1966 and 1980.\\n\\nTextbooks, Professor London finds, my-\\nthologize nature as eternally benign until\\ndisturbed by man. it's a rare schoolbook that\\ntalks about volcanoes belching radiation into\\nthe air, floods that overwhelm river towns,\\nand tornadoes that lift people into oblivion.\\nMoreover, textbooks hardiy mention the\\npromise of a bright future already on the\\nhorizon—when average life expectancy\\nmay approach 90 years, when products\\nderived from recombinant DNA research\\nwill eliminate most viral diseases, when\\nwe will enjoy greater leisure, and mate-\\nrials—especially plastics—will be better,\\nstronger, and safer.\\n\\nProfessor London's conclusion—with\\nwhich we heartily agree—is that we should\\nheip our children think for themselves and\\nreach balanced conclusions. Let's look at\\ntheir textbooks, not to censor them but to\\nraise questions. Let's give them different\\npoints of view and help discuss them. That\\nway we can educate a new generation of\\ncitizens who aren't scared by science, and\\nwho won't be swayed by old mythologies.\\n\\nOur youngsters do have a future.

Abundant\\nand affordable, fossi! fuels have contributed to\\nunprecedented prosperity for much of the\\nhuman race. In decades to come, the benefits\\nof modern fossil fuel energy will extend even\\nfurther.\\n\\nBut fossil fuels coexist alongside \"renew-\\nable\" energy alternatives. Renewable energy is\\ninexhaustible for all practical purposes (solar\\npower, wind) or is routinely\\n\"renewed\" through natural\\nprocesses (hydropower,\\nplant-based fuels). Nuclear\\npower, which is essentially\\ninexhaustible, shares sev-\\neral similarities with renew-\\nables.\\n\\nInterest in renewables\\nhas grown with the in-\\ncreased attention to cli-\\nmate change, as most\\nrenewables co not directly add to greenhouse\\ngases.\\n\\nHydropower and nuclear power to-\\ngether supply about 12 percent of U.S. energy.\\nThese sources are not growing, however.\\nHydroelectric dams are site-limited as well as\\ncontroversial due to their environmental im-\\npacts. Nuclear-plant sittng and nuclear-waste\\ndisposal issues are highly contentious, and new\\nconstruction has been slow and costly.\\n\\nBiofuels based on wood have been eco-\\nnomic and successful in the U S. in limited ap-\\nplications such as fuel in pulp and paper mills.\\n\\nCorn-based ethanol is used as a gasoline\\nadditive in some areas, but is only competitive\\ndue to federal and state tax subsidies that can\\nexceed 60 cents a gallon. Ethanol can also re-\\nquire considerable energy to produce and re-\\n\\n \\n\\nThough promising,\\nrenewable energy’s\\npotential should\\nbe tempered\\nwith realism.\\n\\nquires significant land. For example, making\\nenough ethanol to fuel cars in California alone\\nwould consume America\\'s entire corn crop.\\n\\nWind and solar power are very limited in *\\n\\ncurrent application, together providing less than\\n\\none-tenth of one percent of U.S. energy needs. :\\n\\nWind power, which generally enjoys tax\\n\\nsubsidies, is approaching conventional fossil °\\n\\nsources In cost. Some states mandate that util-\\n\\nt\\n\\nities purchase wind-generated power. Unfortu- :\\n\\nnately, large windmill\\n\\narrays are land-intensive |\\n\\nand even with carefully se-\\nlected sites power output\\nvaries with the wind on any\\ngiven day, requiring back-\\nup generation. Neverthe-\\nless, wind power is\\ngrowing rapidly.\\n\\nThough the cost of\\nphotovoltaic solar power\\nis declining, it is currently 8\\nto 10 times more expensive than conventional\\nelectrical power generation. It has found niche,\\n\\noff-grid applications, and is, like wind, growing °\\n\\nrapidly from a smail base.\\n\\nSolar power is dependent on sunlight\\navailability and is space-intensive. Here again,\\nits potential must be tempered with realism. For\\nexample, we use solar panels for supplemen-\\ntary water heating at our office building in\\nFairfax, Virginia, but providing for all of the site\\'s\\ncomparatively modest power needs would re-\\nquire over 300 acres of solar panels.\\n\\nThough renewables are promising, it is\\nimportant to keep the size of their contribution\\nand their current limitations in perspective.

Although CO,\\nemissions from developed and developing\\ncountries are about equal today, the push for\\neconomic growth will lead to a doubling of\\nemissions from developing countries over the\\nnext 30 years. In the meantime, emissions\\nfrom developed countries will begin to level off.\\n\\ng in the transportation sector, global\\nCOs, emissions will continue to grow, even as\\ndeveloped countries rapidly integrate advanced\\nfuel-efficient technologies. Developed coun-\\ntries could push vehicle emissions back to\\n1990 levels by 2020, but it would require an\\nunprecedented rate of transition to a hybrid\\nand fuel ceil fleet.\\n\\nm@ Similarly, in the electric power sector,\\ngrowing demand will boost CO. emissions\\neven with rapid implementation of highly\\nefficient generating technology. Renewable\\nforms of energy could play a role, but they\\nhave limitations that make them impractical\\nor expensive for most applications. Solar, with\\na cost breakthrough, along with CO, capture\\nand storage, offers the greatest potential in\\nthis sector.\\n\\n  \\n\\ng in the residential/commercia!l and\\nindustrial sectors, once again the rise in CO,\\nemissions is inevitable because of economic\\ngrowth. Cogeneration offers the best opportu-\\nnities to reduce emissions in these sectors.\\n\\nLonger-Term (To 2100). Reasonable\\nforecasts suggest that by 2100 CO, emissions\\ncould quadruple, which would almost double\\ntoday’s concentration of CO, in the atmosphere.\\n\\nIf stabilization of CO, concentration inthe\\n\\natmosphere were to become a policy objec-\\ntive, it would take a concerted effort, requiring:\\n\\ngi Great strides in increased energy °'\\n\\nefficiency, implementation of advanced tech-\\nnology, a switch to renewable energy and low-\\ncarbon fuels, additional investment in nuclear\\npower and capture and storage of CO,.\\n\\n@ Unprecedented global participation and\\nmanagement of the world’s energy resources.\\n\\nClearly, stabilization could be achieved\\nonly at considerable cost. It’s also clear that\\ndoing too much too soon, before new tech-\\nnology is proven and available, would add to\\nthe cost.\\n\\nGlobal economic models suggest that\\nthere is a penalty for haste.

More importantly, the\\nU.S. plan recognizes that developing countries,\\nwhich will become tomorrow's largest carbon\\nemitters, must participate in the solution. The\\npresident said the U.S. will not “assume binding\\nobligations unless key developing nations mean-\\ningfuily participate in this effort.” The problem is\\nthat if they aren't signatories and participants to\\na treaty that binds them to action, then there’s no\\nglobal solution.\\n\\nEnergy conservation and development\\nof energy-efficient technologies in the U.S. via\\ntax cuts and other incentives are also under\\nconsideration.\\n\\nAt first reading, the U.S. proposal seems\\nmoderate. We're encouraged by the cail for\\nvoluntary, market-based steps.

Professor Freeman J.

Yet, an action plan with\\nbinding commitments on developed nations\\ncould take shape by year's end.\\n\\nWe are concerned that policy makers are\\nnot considering the implications of controlling\\nCO, emissions. Studies have examined some of\\nthe emission-centrol plans tabled to date and\\nconcluded that they will impose painful burdens\\non developed economies, particularly if timeta-\\nbles are short and targets unrealistic. For Amer-\\nicans, such solutions mean jobs will disappear\\nand lifestyles will be pinched as our industrial\\ninfrastructure shrinks.\\n\\nA study just issued by Charles River\\nAssociates (CRA) provides additional weight to\\nthe impact of emission controls in an age of\\nglobal markets. The report shows how ill-timed or\\nill-considered abatement measures could stunt\\nworld economic growth, unsettle global trading\\n\\n| patterns and set the stage for a new era of trade\\nprotectionism.\\n\\nCRA analyzed two abatement scenarios —\\none a more modest stabilization proposal, the\\nother a more aggressive reduction plan. Both\\npolicies appear to fall within the boundaries of\\naccéptability by the U.S. government. The\\nauthors utilized a carbon-rationing plan to\\nachieve required reductions in CO, emissions. In\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nhttp:/Awww.mobil.com\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nlisten\\nieap\\n\\npractice, rationing will increase energy prices for\\nboth industry and the consumer.\\n\\nThe cost of limiting emissions could range\\nfrom $200 to $580 per ton of carbon, depending\\non the timing and severity of the plan selected.\\nTo put this in perspective, this equates to an\\nadditional cost to consumers of 50 cents to\\n$1.50 per gallon of gasoline in today’s dollars.\\n\\nThe expected blow to U.S. prosperity\\nwould be considerable, according to CRA: an\\nannual drop in gross domestic product ranging\\nfrom $105 billion in the year 2010 to $460 billion\\nin 2030, both in today's dollars. At the lower\\nrange, this works out to a loss in annual house-\\nhold income of roughly $1,000.\\n\\nOne key finding of CRAs study is that the\\neconomic burden of emissions controls is borne\\nnot only by the industrialized countries, but also\\nby developing societies, who under current pro-\\nposals need do nothing. The developed world\\nfeels the pain as it is forced to switch fuels and\\nrevamp its industrial infrastructure. The develop-\\ning world, which now exports GO to 75 percent of\\nits products to industrialized countries, will see\\nthose markets shrivel as economic growth stalls\\nand demand for protectionist measures grows.\\nDeveloping countries that import energy will ben-\\nefit from lower fossil-fuel prices, but in most\\ncases that gain won't offset the loss of trading\\nmarkets. And energy exporters— be they devel-\\noped or developing — will be particularly hard hit\\nas energy markets shrink.\\n\\nThe CRA study injects a healthy dose of real-\\nism into the climate-change debate. In the coming\\nmonths, we'll continue to look at what other\\nexperts are saying. Meanwhile, we urge interna-\\ntional policy makers not to make 1997 a year of\\nhasty decisions.

Nations are gathered\\nthis month in Geneva for the Second Conference\\nof Parties meeting. Negotiations wilt culminate\\nlate next year and could result in legally binding\\ntargets, timetables and common measures to\\nreduce greenhouse-gas emissions.

We are presenting this editorial series in the\\nhope that it will help contribute to a rational and\\nproductive discussion on global climate change.\\n\\nThe greenhouse effect is a natural phenom-\\nenon. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere\\nand warms Earth's surface. Radiant heat is emit-\\nted back to the atmosphere; some of it is ab-\\nsorbed by greenhouse gases—-water vapor,\\ncarbon dioxide (CO.) and methane— and reemit-\\nted back to Earth, causing further warming. This\\nheat trapping is known as the greenhouse\\neffect—an occurrence that makes our planet\\nhabitable. Naturally occurring greenhouse gases\\n— predominantly water vapor— account for 95 to\\n97 percent of the current effect. The other 3 to 5\\npercent is attributable to man’s activities. Aj-\\nthough CO; is the predominant emissions con-\\ntributor, methane, in the short term, has 25 times\\n\\nthe effect of CO2.\\n\\nWorldwide, the burning of fossil fuels cou-\\npled with massive deforestation yields some 20\\nbillion metric tons of COz annually. About half\\nthese emissions wind up in the atmosphere. The\\nrest is believed to be absorbed by increased\\nplant growth and the oceans. We know little\\nabout this nonatmospheric absorption, which\\ncomplicates decision-making. For example, how\\nmight plant growth and absorption by the ocean\\nchange with higher global temperatures? More-\\nover, greenhouse-gas emissions, which have a\\nwarming effect, are offset by another combustion\\nproduct—particulates—which leads to cooling.\\n\\nOne thing we do know is that greenhouse\\ngases reside in the atmosphere for long periods\\nof time and are dispersed over the entire globe.\\nThat means their potential impact on climate\\nshould be viewed cumulatively rather than on the\\noutput from any one country or in any one year.\\nThe concentration of greenhouse gases is build-\\ning up slowly—less than 0.5 percent annually for\\nCO,—and that gives us time to implement effec-\\ntive mitigation measures.\\n\\nThe industrialized countries and the\\ndeveloping world contribute about equally to pre-\\nsent-day CO:2 emissions, but the pattern is shift-\\ning rapidly, as the peoples of Africa, Asia and\\nLatin America seek to better their lives. The devel-\\noping nations argue that the industrialized world\\nhas no right to impose its environmental rules on\\nthem, possibly short-circuiting their industrial rev-\\nolution, without compensation or dispensations.\\n\\nThis raises thorny social and economic is-\\nsues.

If developed nations act alone to reduce\\nemissions, the staggering cost imposed on en-\\nergy-intensive industries will drive nations to ex-\\nport much of their industrial base to countries\\nwith less stringent controls.\\n\\nWorld economic health will suffer as nations\\nare forced to switch from fossil fuels, saddled\\nwith large carbon taxes and driven to prema-\\nturely scrap many factories and machinery. The\\ndislocations will be even more severe if the solu-\\ntions are not implemented globally.\\n\\nThis does not mean we shouid hope for the\\nbest and do nothing.

Other energy sources—solar, nuclear\\nand wind— emit virtually no gases, yet often face\\nserious economic and political obstacles.\\n\\nConstructive steps that involve participation\\n\\n“by all nations and flexible timing should be con-\\n\\nsidered now. Efforts should be directed at stabi-\\nlizing and reducing emissions when and where\\nthey are most cost effective. For example, one\\ncontrol scenario being discussed — stabilizing\\nCO, emissions today and implementing a 20 per-\\ncent reduction in industrialized countries starting\\nin 2010—could cost $2.6 trillion. Spreading the\\nresponsibility globally—allowing trading of emis-\\nsion credits—would lower the cost to some $1.1\\ntrillion; adding flexibility in timing— allowing cu-\\nmulative rather than annual emission targets out\\nto the year 2050—would bring total costs down\\nto $0.5 trillion. Some studies indicate the flexible\\nroute could achieve the same long-term benefits\\nas the “quicker” plan.\\n\\nAs negotiators grapple with these issues,\\nthey would do well to heed the U.N.’s preliminary\\nguidelines: “Measures to deal with climate\\nchange should be cost-effective so as to ensure\\nglobal benefits at the lowest possible cost.” Jobs\\nand livelihoods are at stake. Current and future\\ngenerations are counting on us to manage the\\nchallenge wisely.\\n\\nWe intend to follow up on the results of the\\nJury conference in Geneva to look at the eco-\\n\\nnomic impact that emission reduction proposals\\n\\ncould have on nations.

But few people ever heard of\\na major document issued at the same time and\\nCalled the “Heidelberg Appeal.” The reason? it\\njust didn’t make “news.”\\n\\n. Perhaps that is because the Appeal urged\\nSummit attendees to avoid making important\\nenvironmental decisions based on “pseudo-\\nscientific arguments or false and non-relevant\\ndata.”\\n\\nThe Heidelberg Appeal was issued initially\\nby some 264 scientists from around the world,\\nincluding 52 Nobel Prize winners. Today, the\\nAppeal carries the signatures of more than\\n2,300 scientists — 65 of thern Nobel Prize win-\\nners—from 79 countries. If nothing else, its mes-\\nsage is illustrative of what's wrong with so much\\nof the global warming rhetoric. The lack of solid\\nscientific data.\\n\\nScientists can agree on ceriain facts per-\\ntaining to global warming. First, the greenhouse\\neffect is a natural phenomenon; it accounts for\\nthe moderate temperature that makes our\\nplanet habitable. Second, the concentration of\\ngreenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide) has\\nincreased and there has been a slight increase in\\ngloba! temperatures over the past century.\\nFinally, if present trends continue, carbon diox-\\nide levels will double over the next 50 to 100\\nyears.\\nControversy arises when trying to link past\\nchanges in temperatures to increased concen-\\n\\ncalypse no\\n\\ntrations of greenhouse gases. And it arises\\nagain when climate prediction models are used\\nto conclude Earth's temperature will climb dras-\\ntically in the next century and—based on such\\nmodels—to propose policy decisions that could\\ndrastically affect the economy.\\n\\n_ According to Arizona State University\\nclimatologist Dr. Robert C. Bailing in his book,\\nThe Heated Debate (San Francisco: Pacific\\nResearch Institute for Public Policy, 1992), until\\nknowledge of the interplay between oceans and\\nthe atmosphere improves, “model predictions\\nmust be treated with considerable caution.”\\nMoreover, models don't simulate the complexity\\nof clouds, nor do they deal adequately with sea\\nice, snow or changes in intensity of the sun's\\nenergy.\\n\\nAnd they don’t stand up to reality testing.\\nComparing actual temperatures over the last\\n100 years against model cafculations, the mod-\\nels predicted temperature increases higher than\\nthose that actually occurred. Moreover, most of\\nthe earth's temperature increase over the last\\ncentury occurred before 1940. Yet, the real build-\\nup in man-made CO, didn't occur until after\\n1940. Temperatures actually fell between 1940\\nand 1970.\\n\\nSifting through such data, Dr. Balling has\\nconcluded, “there is a large amount of empirical\\nevidence suggesting that the apocalyptic vision\\nis in error and that the highly touted greenhouse\\ndisaster is most improbable.”\\n\\nOther scientists have an even more inter-\\nesting viewpoint. Notes atmospheric physicist\\nS. Fred Singer, president of the Washington,\\nD.C.-based Science & Environmental Policy\\nProject, “the net impact [of a modest warming]\\nmay well be beneficial.”\\n\\nAll of which would seem to suggest that\\nthe jury's still out on whether drastic steps to\\ncurb CO, emissions are needed. it would seem\\nthat the phenomenon-- and its impact on the\\neconomy— are important enough to warrant\\nconsiderably more research before proposing\\nactions we may later regret.\\n\\nPerhaps the sky Isn't falling, after all.\\n\\nMobil\\n\\n© 1933 Mobs Corporation\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

We assess energy efficiencies and\\nthe total carbon dioxide emissions of various\\ntechnologies from the production of the energy\\nthrough to final consumer use. In doing so, we\\n“level the playing field” in order to understand\\nthe full cost and environmental impact of ve-\\nhicle fuel production and use.\\n\\nFor example, hydrogen-powered\\nfuel-cell cars are commonly hailed as being\\nemissions-free and having much better\\nfuel econamy than today’s vehicles.\\nAlthough this is true for the vehicles, it\\n\\n_ fails to consider the energy require-\\nments and the carbon dioxide gener-\\nated for the production and\\ndistrioution of hydrogen. :\\n\\nThe most economical way to\\nproduce hydrogen — from natural gas\\n— generates significantly more\\ncarbon dioxide than does the\\nproduction of gasoline, is less\\nenergy-efficient and yields a\\nfue! that is costlier and more ~\\ndifficult to store and transport.\\n\\nMaking hydrogen from the elec-\\ntrolysis of water is energy-intensive. and if today’s\\nmix of U.S. electricity were used, well-to-wheels\\ncarbon dioxide emissions would actually be\\nhigher than those for today's gasoline-powered\\ncars. The cost of the fuel would also quadruple.\\n\\nUsing solar power for electricity could elim-\\ninate the carbon dioxide emissions but would\\nraise fuel costs even more.\\n\\nIn contrast, producing, transporting, refining\\nand delivering petroleum fuels are efficient\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n\\nprocesses. More than four-fifths of the original\\nenergy in crude oil is delivered to your cars.\\nHowever, the vehicles themselves are relatively in-\\nefficient. Less than 20 percent of the energy in\\ngasoline ultimately moves your vehicle. The rest is\\nlost to exhaust heat and mechanical friction.\\nThough diesels, which are common in\\nEurope, are slightly more efficient and emit\\nless carbon dioxide than gasoline cars, they\\nalso have higher emissions of particu-\\nlates and smog-causing nitrogen oxides\\nand have difficulty meeting U.S. tailpipe\\nstandards.\\nGasoline/electric and diesel/electric\\nhybrid vehicles show promise. Due to\\ntheir improved fuel economy, they have\\nbetter well-to-wheels efficiency, lower\\ncarbon emissions and fuel costs on a\\ncent-per-mile-traveled basis than\\ntheir conventional counterparts,\\nbut .a higher vehicle cost\\ntoday, |\\nThese efficiency and\\nemissions challenges of\\ninternal combustion engine\\nvehicles are the reasons\\nwe work with others to improve the\\nfuel/vehicle system. A small increase in\\nautomotive efficiency would make a big difference\\nin emissions when eventually applied to the hun-\\ndreds of millions of vehicles on the world’s roads.\\nSo technology, environmental emissions\\nand cost considerations all have to be considered\\n~—— with consumer utility — when evaluating the\\nnext generation of automobiles and fuels.

Using the\\nwidely respected Global Energy Model devel-\\noped by Battelle, we examined two potential\\ntargets that are often discussed by policy-\\nmakers. What would it take to stabilize CO,\\nconcentrations at twice the preindustrial level?\\nAnd what would it take for stabilization at twice\\ntoday’s level?\\n\\nThe tougher goal—stabilization at twice\\npreindustrial levels—would mean reducing\\nglobal CO, emissions by almost 75 percent\\nbeyond what they would be with ongoing\\nimprovements in energy efficiency.

Globally, electric gen-\\n\\nat “Se Last week, we saw that, for the fore-\\n\\nseeable future, energy use will\\n\\nZa\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nincrease in tandem with world eco-\\nnomic growth. With fossil fuels\\npowering much of that climb, CO,\\nemissions will also increase. Continuing our\\nassessment, we now look at the various sectors of\\nthe economy to see what role advanged technol-\\nogy could play in reducing CO, emissions by 2030.\\n\\nCan technology make a difference? The\\nanswer is, “it depends.”\\n\\nFor developed countries, it can. Their econ-\\nomies are mature and their populations are largely\\nstabilized, so investing in energy efficiency can\\nhalt the growth in CO, emissions. In developing\\ncountries, capital is scarcer, other needs are more\\npressing and growth in fuel use far outstrips the\\nimpact of normal efficiency gains.\\n\\nLet's see what is possible:\\n\\nTransportation: The technology for\\ntomorrow's passenger vehicles is in various\\nstages of development. Advanced diesel engines\\nare the closest to market. While hybrid and fuel-\\ncell vehicles may take longer to become com-\\nmercially viable, both promise to markedly\\nreduce CO, emissions. But the long life of pas-\\nsenger vehicles (12-15 years on average) and the\\ntime required for new technology to dominate the\\nautomotive fleet mean that a big change is not\\naround the corner.\\n\\nlf the U.S., Western Europe and Japan\\nrapidly adopted these new vehicle technologies,\\nautomotive CO, emissions there could be sub-\\nstantially below their 1990 level by 2030.\\n\\nHowever, carbon dioxide from transporta-\\ntion will more than double by 2030, driven largely\\nby an increase in the number of vehicles in devel-\\noping countries and continued growth in other\\ntransportation modes— aviation, shipping and\\ntrucking. So even with all these improvements,\\nglobal transportation emissions would be\\nreduced only by about seven percent from that\\nprojected for 2030.\\n\\neration is projected to triple over the next 30 years\\nand associated CO, emissions will more than\\ndouble. If developed countries moved to more ©\\nefficient plants and switched to lower-carbon fuels\\n(natural gas), they could cut their projected CO,\\nemissions by as much as 40 percent in this time |\\nframe. Again, growth in the rest of the world will -\\nfar surpass this reduction.\\n\\nRenewables can be a factor. Biomass and\\nwind are nearing cost competitiveness with new\\npower generators, but they have inherent capac-\\nity limitations. Solar’s role could be larger if tech-\\nnological breakthroughs drive down its current\\nhigh costs. Another promising alternative is the ..\\ncapture of CO. produced by fossil fuel power °\\nplants and its storage permanently underground\\nin depleted oil and gas reservoirs.\\n\\nIndustrial: This sector is generally energy-\\nefficient, but advanced technology (more efficient\\nboilers, motors, etc.) and greater use of cogenera-\\ntion could slow emissions growth. Cogeneration\\nutilizes waste heat from power generation for\\nother purposes, such as heating.\\n\\nResidential/commercial: Upgrading and\\nretrofitting homes/buildings can improve energy\\nefficiency. But gains here over the next 30 years\\nare limited by the slow rate of building turnover (50\\nto 100 years) and the high cost of energy-saving\\ntechnologies.\\n\\nWhat can be gained? Advanced technology\\nwidely implemented by developed nations can cut -\\nglobal emissions by eight million tons from a pro-\\njected 45 billion tons annually in 2030. The sheer\\ngrowth— more than doubling—in emissions that\\nwill occur in the rest of the world simply over-\\nwhelms these reductions.\\n\\nNext week we'll look beyond 2030.\\n\\nFor a copy of Climate: Technology and Carbon Dioxide\\nEmissions—A Global Review and Assessment, please\\ncall 1-800-293-5796.\\n\\nom\\nMobil The energy\\n\\nwww.mopbil.com\\n\\n‘\\n\\nto make a difference..\\n\\n©1999 Mobi Corporation\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Without this trapped\\nheat the earth would be 60 degrees cooler and,\\nto say the least, a far tess livable home.\\n\\nThere's some possibility the temperature in\\nour greenhouse is rising—and that certain gases\\nassociated with industrial activity and population\\ngrowth may now be trapping more of the sun's\\nenergy than has been the case in the past. This\\nphenomenon has been called the greenhouse\\neffect. What should be done about it—and when\\nand by whom—is now under discussion by\\nindustry, science, and government all around\\nthe world.\\n\\nGlobal temperatures seem to be increasing.\\nOver the last hundred years, the annual average\\nis up by one degree Fahrenheit, with the warmest\\nyears coming recently, in the ‘80s. There's new\\nevidence to suggest the oceans are getting both\\nwarmer and slightly higher than they had been.\\nScientists do not agree on the cause and signifi-\\ncance of these changes—but many believe\\nthere's reason for concern about levels of “green-\\nhouse gases” in earth's atmosphere.\\n\\nMost of that atmosphere—over 99 percent—\\nis made up of oxygen and nitrogen, which don't\\ntrap radiant heat. But certain trace gases do, and\\nof these the major four—dubbed the greenhouse\\ngases—are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous\\noxide, and the man-made chemicals known as\\nthe CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons.\\n\\nCarbon dioxide is the most abundant of\\nthese trace gases in the atmosphere, but rela-\\ntively the weakest in its heat-trapping attributes.\\nits concentration has been rising, primarily from\\nthe increased worldwide combustion of fossil\\nfuels over the last 150 years or so, but also in part\\nfrom deforestation. Scientists estimate that car-\\nbon dioxide causes about 50 percent of any\\ngreenhouse effect.\\n\\nMethane is estimated to produce about 17\\npercent of that effect. A small part of this\\nmethane comes from the use or production of\\nfossil fuels. But most of it is either from decom-\\nposing organic matter—like animal wastes and\\nwood—or from natural or agricultural processes\\non the land, in peat bogs, swamps, and rice pad-\\n\\ndies, for example.\\n\\nAnother 17 percent of the greenhouse\\neffect—but this is the portion increasing fastest—\\nis said to be caused by the CFCs. These manu-\\nfactured chemicals, used in refrigeration, aero-\\nsols, and industrial solvents, are already\\nrestricted internationally because they were said\\nto be destroying earth's protective upper-atmo-\\nsphere ozone layer. The search for substitutes is\\nin progress, and it’s a safe guess that CFC pro-\\nduction and use will eventually be eliminated.\\n(Mobil makes no use of CFCs in its products.)\\n\\nNitrous oxide, which accounts for perhaps\\nsix percent of the greenhouse effect, comes into\\nthe atmosphere mainly from soil processes act-\\ning on nitrogen fertilizers, with a small amount\\nproduced in fue! combustion.\\n\\nThe principal focus in discussions about\\ncontrol of the greenhouse effect is on carbon\\ndioxide and the CFCs. The fatter are already\\n\\n‘ being phased out by international agreement—\\n\\nwhich leaves reduction of carbon dioxide emis-\\nsions at center stage.\\n\\nThe global climate is so huge and various\\nthat no easy formulas—or easy answers—apply.\\nNor do we fully understand the role of the oceans\\nin absorbing and releasing carbon dioxide from\\nand into the atmosphere. While much research\\nremains to be done, we're already seeing world-\\nwide pressure to reduce the atmospheric build-\\nup of carbon dioxide. For this, there seem to\\nbe only two practical options: conservation in\\nthe use of fossil fuels, and vigorous develop-\\nment of alternative energy sources—those with\\nless carbon, like natural gas, and those without\\ncarbon, such as nuclear power, solar, and\\nhydroelectricity.\\n\\nAll must be explored as we face up to the\\npossibility of global warming. Some public offi-\\ncials have targeted transportation fuels, but it's\\nwell to remember that in the whole world, high-\\nway vehicles account for only five percent of any\\nwarming trend. U.S. vehicles would account for\\nnot even half of this.\\n\\nMobil is very much aware that cleaner, more\\nefficient, and more carefully used fossil fuels will\\ncut the risk of global warming, and we're hard at\\nwork along all these fronts. We live in the green-\\nhouse too.\\n\\nNiobil\\n\\n©1989 Mobi! Corporation\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Other\\ntimes, the team streamlined entire processes,\\nsuch as compressed air production or heat and\\nsteam systems.\\n\\nTheir efforts have escalated. Now, teams —\\n\\nare incorporating energy-wise design into all of\\n\\nMobil’s U.S. company-operated stations, includ- «\\n\\ning On The Run” sites. We hope to share these\\nenergy-saving steps with Mobil’s franchisee net-\\nwork across the nation. It\\'s the kind of voluntary\\n“can-do” that led to the EPA’s EnerGy STar®\\nBuildings award.\\n\\nWe\\'re proud to be a charter member of the\\nEPA\\'s program. Not only has it helped our bot-\\ntom line, it also contributes to our efforts to\\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. These steps\\ninclude installing energy-saving technology at\\nrefineries, reducing gas flaring in our offshore\\nproducing fields ard eliminating methane leaks.\\nIn the last three years, we\\'ve cut our carbon\\nemissions by more than one million metric tons\\nand will continue to look for further reductions.\\n\\nWhile Mobil is taking prudent, responsible\\nsteps now to voluntarily reduce our emissions and\\nthose of our customers, similar efforts by con-\\nsumers can help, too. Steps like choosing more\\nenergy-efficient appliances, upgrading homes to\\nmake them more fuel-efficient or combining\\nerrands when driving can make a difference.\\n\\nLet\\'s show a little voluntary “can do.” Wise\\nenergy management is everyone\\'s business.\\n\\nFor information on EPA\\'s ENerGy STAR* pro-\\ngram, contact: 1-888-STAR YES (1-888-782-7937).\\n\\naE:\\nNMiobil The energy\\n\\nhttp wwyemobd com ¥\\n\\nto make a difference.\\n\\n2 Oa Mop Cao bioratiit:\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

As world leaders gather at the United\\n(Fy Nations to review our planet’s progress\\n\\nei on sustainable development, we expect\\nthey also will caucus on the issue of climate\\nchange. The reason: In just six months in Kyoto,\\nJapan, nations are poised to settle on a plan to\\nreduce greenhouse gases.\\n\\nIt began five years ago in Rio de Janiero,\\nwhen nations agreed to formulate a pian to reduce\\ngreenhouse gases. The concern is that the build-\\nup of these gases (carbon dioxide, methane and\\nnitrous oxide) in the atmosphere could cause\\nclimate change.\\n\\nThe agreement that will likely emerge from\\nthe Kyoto meeting will commit only industrialized\\nnations to binding targets and timetables to con-\\ntrol their emissions of greenhouse gases; other\\nnations may be asked to participate in this\\nprocess, but they are not bound to action.\\nEmission abatement pians have focused primar-\\nity on COs, which is produced when coal, oil and\\nnatural gas are burned. Much is at stake in these\\nupcoming global climate discussions —not just a\\nhabitable planet for future generations, but also a\\nworld where all nations can provide for the eco-\\nnomic well-being of their citizens.\\n\\nWe encourage governments to take the\\ntime to do it right—to examine the science,\\ndecide if emission levels are dangerous and then\\nevaluate steps to effectively mitigate or reduce\\nfuture emissions. If the wrong decision is made, it\\ncould be divisive — pitting industrialized countries\\n\\nagainst developing nations—and derail the seri- -\\n\\nous effort that may be needed to stabilize emis-\\nsion levels.\\n\\nA number of emission proposals have been\\ntabled. They deserve the attention of all govern-\\nment actors—not only environmental ministers,\\nbut also the economic and finance ministers.\\nAbatement measures need to be flexible so\\nnations can benefit from new technology and\\nimproved understanding of the science and eco-\\nnomics of climate change.\\n\\nInstead of rigid targets and timetables, gov-\\nernments should consider alternatives, including:\\n\\n@ Adopt consensus objectives; encourage\\nvoluntary initiatives and government-industry\\npartnerships that will help attain these goals.\\n\\nw Target all greenhouse gases, not just COz;\\nencourage development of sinks— activities that\\noffset or reduce these gases—like reforestation\\nand improved agricultural practices.\\n\\nm Encourage development and dispersion\\nof new technology to assure widespread adop-\\ntion of cost-effective abatement approaches.\\n\\nWhile the likely Kyoto agreement will directly\\naffect only industrialized nations, the burden will\\nultimately be borne by others. Many studies point\\nout that in a world where economies are increas-\\ningly integrated, energy exporters and developing\\nnations will suffer as well. As industrial economies\\nare driven to switch fuels and revamp their indus-\\ntrial bases, their growth will falter, altering trade\\npatterns throughout the world.\\n\\nA draft U.S. Department of Energy study on\\nsix energy-intensive industries indicates that high\\nenergy prices, which would follow from stiff com-\\nmitments to reduce CO, emissions, would have a\\ncrushing effect on these sectors. And despite the\\nblow to U.S. jobs and this industrial base, it is\\nunlikely that overall emissions would be reduced\\nbecause the manufacturing capacity would mi-\\ngrate to countries not bound by emission limits.\\n\\nCongress is also concerned. Sixty-one U.S.\\nsenators are calling for further review of the cli-\\nmate change issue. Since a binding agreement\\nsigned by the U.S. will require Senate ratifica-\\ntion, many legislators believe any emission re-\\nduction plan should include an estimate of its\\neconomic impact.\\n\\nClearly, curbing greenhouse gases is the\\nresponsibility of all nations. By early next century,\\nfast-growing, developing nations will be the largest\\ncarbon emitters. That’s why it is incumbent on all\\nnations to participate in the solution even in the\\nshort term.\\n\\nAs officials head home, we urge them to\\nreflect on the decisions that they will enter into\\nlater this year.

Take the promise of cleaner\\nair—a promise some states have used to\\nmandate the sale of electric vehicles (EVs).\\n\\nAccording to a recent U.S. General\\nAccounting Office (GAO) report, when the\\nimpact of electricity generation is included, new\\nEVs use more energy and generate more air pol-\\nlution than the average new gasoline-powered\\ncar. Other roadblocks to widespread use of EVs\\ninclude battery technology, cost, safety and\\nconvenience. Efforts to overcome these barriers\\nthe GAO noted, “are inherently risky and will\\nrequire substantial time, money and attention.”\\n\\nThe biggest push for EVs has come from\\nthe states, though federal support exists as\\nwell. Without waiting for evidence that EVs\\ncan deliver, California, Massachusetts and\\nNew York have mandated market shares for\\nEVs—2 percent of new car sales in 1998, ris-\\ning to 10 percent by 2003. Other states have\\nsaid they'll keep an EV option open.\\n\\nAfter nearly two years of research, the\\nGAO basically concluded EVs aren't ready.\\nNor are they likely to become so even in the\\nrosiest of scenarios. Here are some key findings:\\n\\n@ Battery technology just cannot com-\\npete with internal combustion engines today\\nor in the foreseeable future in terms of driving\\nrange, power and recharging capability, Today's\\ncommercially available EVs have a driving\\nrange of 30-50 miles under city driving condi-\\n\\ntions. Even advanced technology batteries\\nonly have a range of 80-100 miles.\\n\\nElectric vehicles are expensive—cost-\\ning two to three times more than conventional\\nautos. Even at mass production volumes, EVs\\nwith lead-based batteries are likely to be\\npriced 20 percent higher, while those using\\nmore advanced battery technologies will cost\\nsubstantially more.\\n\\nm EVs present some potential safety haz-\\nards. Some batteries use toxic, corrosive and\\nexplosive chemicals; some use higher voltage,\\nwhich poses a potentially lethal shock hazard.\\nBattery weight may affect a vehicle's maneu-\\nverability; and questions on their “crashworthi-\\nness” remain unanswered.\\n\\nf The environmental benefits of EVs are\\ndubious — particularly if one considers the\\nimpact of generating the required electricity,\\nwhich state regulators should be doing. If they\\ndid they'd know that when EVs are substi-\\ntuted for gasoline-powered autos, primary\\nenergy consumption increases by some 30\\npercent, greenhouse gas emissions rise by 5\\npercent and sulfur dioxide emissions climb\\nover 700 percent.\\n\\nIt's time to take another approach. Man-\\ndates won't make “promises” come true. And\\nputting EVs on the road before they can pro-\\nduce on those promises is the wrong thing to\\ndo to consumers and the nation’s clean air\\neffort. It's a price tag that gives no value for the\\nmoney we'll pay.\\n\\n \\n\\n© 1995 Mobil Corporation\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

A33\\n\\nThe Kyoto Protocol:\\nToo Many gaps\\n\\nLast December, many nations\\nnegotiated the Kyoto Protocol,\\n# which calls for 38 industrialized\\n\\na Fr countries to reduce their emis-\\naw sions of greenhouse gases. While\\nthis agreement certainly isn’t front-page news,\\nthe Protocol, its rules and implementing mech-\\nanisms are generating much discussion among\\ngovernments.\\n\\nThe Senate has voiced its opposition to the\\nProtocol. While Congress has held several cli-\\nmate change hearings, the Administration has\\nnot submitted the treaty to the Senate for ratifica-\\ntion. The next chapter opens in Buenos Aires\\nwhere momentum is building to move the\\nProtocol forward.\\n\\nWe have used this space previously to\\ndescribe the steps we are taking to address the\\npotential climate change issue. We also have\\nused these editorials to express our opposition to\\nthe Kyoto Protocol itself. We think we have a\\nresponsibility to participate in this debate because\\nwe as well as the American public have a stake in\\nthe outcome. Others in the business community\\nhave voiced their concerns.\\n\\nA new report by The Business Roundctable\\n(BRT) catalogs the problems created by the\\nKyoto Protocol, noting it “raises many more\\nquestions than it answers, and leaves too many\\ngaps unfilled... fails to address the global nature\\nof the issue...[and] we are still unable to assess\\nthe full economic ra.ufications of the Protocol:\\n\\nThe BRT is an association of 200 chiet\\nexecutive officers. This report reflects the thinking\\nof a broad spectru..: of business—from barking\\nand finance, insurance and publishing to heavy\\nindustry, telecommunications and chemicals.\\n\\nHere are highlights from “The Kyoto\\nProtocol: A Gap Analysis.”\\n\\n@ “The Protocol mandates an unprece-\\ndented 41 percent reduction of greenhouse gas\\nemissions by 2008-2012 for the United States\\nfrom the business-as-usual path.” The U.S.\\nEnergy Information Agency projects that U.S.\\nemissions will be 34 percent above 1990 levels\\nby 2010. “Thus, what may superficially seem to\\n\\n   \\n\\nbe a modest 7 percent reduction below 1990\\nlevels becomes, in real terms, a legal obligation\\nfor the U.S.” Put in perspective, “it is the equiva-\\nlent of having to eliminate ail current emissions’\\nfrom the transportation, utility or industry sector.” \\'\\nThis will require difficult choices for all Americans.\\n\\nm Developing countries are not covered by\\nthe Protocol. “Without full participation by devel-\\noping countries, the Kyoto Protocol will not\\nlead to a net reduction of global... emissions.”\\nDeveloping countries are becoming the largest\\nemitters and could account for more than half of -\\nall emissions by 2015.\\n\\n@ The Protocol uses “differentiated targets”\\nfor countries to meet, which potentially could put\\nthe U.S. at a disadvantage. “The variable targets .\\nweren\\'t necessarily based on criteria such as .\\ncountries’ growth, energy usage or levels of effi-\\nciency....” The European Union, for example, is”\\nmuch closer to its target than it might seem |\\nbecause those economies were robust in 1990 ,\\nand energy efficiency (particularly in East .\\nGermany) was poor. Since then, their economies -\\nhave weakened and the U.K. has converted from\\ncoal to natural gas. Moreover, the EU nations will\\nbe able to pool their emissions and report as a.\\nsingle entity for compliance purposes. “As a\\nresult, some countries will be able to continue to\\nincrease their emissions.”\\n\\n@ “The establishment of a 1990 emissions\\n‘baseline’ disproportionately affects the United\\nStates.\" That was a recession year for our econ-\\nomy. Subsequent economic growth contributed\\nto an increase in emission levels. Now, America\\nis being penalized for “... having strong economic\\ngrowth since 1990, after the arbitrarily esteb-\\nlisned baseline.”\\n\\nf& And finally, the report notes that Kyoto is\\nsilent on the crucial issues of compliance and \\'\\nenforcement.\\n\\nWhile tne BRT opposes the Protocol, it\\npledges to work with the U.S. government and\\nothers to ensiire a healthy economy and environ-\\nment. That\\'s a good prescription for all of us.

There is no longer a\\nneed for alarmists; but there is aneed for some\\nperspective and some optimism. There’s a lot\\nof good news out there.\\n\\nGregg Easterbrook has given us that per-\\nspective in his recent book, “A Moment on the\\nEarth: The Coming Age of Environmental Opti-\\nmism” (Viking Penguin, 1995). Easterbrook talks\\nabout the dire predictions of the 1960s and\\n1970s that did not come to pass, sheds light on\\nthe tenacity of the Earth and discusses how\\nmuch good has already occurred, while not\\ndiminishing the work that remains to be done.\\n\\nThe robin, which some believed would be\\nextinct by now, is still one of the most prolific\\nbirds in the United States. The 1980s saw not\\nwidespread starvation as some had forecast,\\nbut an agricultural abundance. The supply of\\npetroleum that some said would be exhausted\\nby the 1990s is stil! ample.\\n\\nAs Easterbrook points out, air in the U.S.\\nis significantly cleaner in the '90s than it was in\\nthe '70s. Smog in the U.S. declined even as\\nthe economy grew and the number of cars on\\n\\n \\n\\nis not falling\\n\\nthe road increased. Air pollution from tead\\ndeclined by more than 90 percent, and emis-\\nsions that form smog and acid rain declined\\nsubstantially. The number of cities that do not\\nmeet national ambient air-quality standards has\\ndeclined by 50 percent since the mid-’70s. This\\niS progress.\\n\\n‘ And to those who think industry and\\nnature cannot coexist, we say show a little\\nrespect for Mother Nature. She is one strong\\nlady, resilient and capable of rejuvenation. The\\nenvironment recovers well from both natural\\nand man-made disasters.\\n\\nWhen Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980,\\nit destroyed 200 square miles of land and 19\\nmillion old-growth trees. Just 15 years later,\\nmuch of the area has recovered. New genera-\\ntions of elk have learned to feed in new-growth\\nforests rather than old growth. Coho salmon,\\nthought unable to survive in the now unnatu-\\nrally warm waters of the area, are thriving. Even\\nAlaska’s Prince William Sound survived a 1989\\noil spill and today is biologically alive thanks to\\nthe remarkable powers of nature.\\n\\nIn his book, Easterbrook points out nature\\nitself has produced far more devastating changes\\nthan any caused by man—ice ages, meteor\\nstrikes, large-scale volcanic eruptions that\\nspewed millions of tons of “pollutants” into the\\nair—and the environment has survived.\\n\\nDoes this justify or lessen the impact of\\nindustrial pollution? Of course not. Our point is —\\nthat nature, over the millennia, has learned to\\ncope. Mother Nature is pretty successful in tak-\\ning on human nature.\\n\\nThere are pienty of legitimate environmen-\\ntal problems yet to be tackled.

But this\\nking of the road could be challenged by diesel-\\npowered vehicles. A renewed focus on more\\nefficient family transportation is fueling this race.\\nIn the jate 1970s, concern over gasoline\\nsupplies and prices prompted some American\\nmotorists to travel down the diesel engine path.\\nFor most, though, this was a short-lived detour.\\nNot so in Europe where diesel-powered\\nautos now enjoy a substantial market share.\\nThe reason: government policies—namely,\\nhigh gasoline taxes—have encouraged their\\npurchase and use.\\n\\nMotorists with long memories will recall\\nthat the early diesel-powered cars were noisy\\nand slow to accelerate, and had starting prob-\\nlems in cold weather. Add diesel’s exhaust\\nfumes and the difficulty drivers had finding ser-\\nvice stations with diesel pumps and it’s no\\nwonder these cars never seriously threatened\\nthe popular gasoline-powered cars.\\n\\nBut that was yesterday. Today, virtually all\\nthe performance problems are being solved, so\\nthe diesel could become a viable player, provid-\\ning motorists with a clean, efficient option.\\n\\nOverall, the diesel is 30 percent to\\nAO percent more fuel efficient than a gasoline-\\npowered car. That improves the driving range\\nfor motorists while reducing their costs. It also\\nhelps automakers who must meet the govern-\\nment's Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency\\n(CAFE) goals. And, burning less fuel means\\nemitting less carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas\\nwhich could contribute to climate change.\\n\\nDiesel-powered autos, though, create\\nemissions challenges. The automotive and\\noil industries developed highly sophisticated\\n\\n \\n\\ntechnologies over 30 years to reduce tailpipe\\nemissions from gasoline engines. The diesel\\nsystem, though, is behind the curve. Emission\\ntechnology for the diesel needs time to catch\\nup to overcome these hurdles.\\n\\nThe evolution of a new family vehicle is a\\nprocess too big for any one company, or any\\none industry, to guide. It did get a jump start\\nseveral years ago with the formation of a\\ngovernment/auto industry program called\\nPartnership for a New Generation of Vehicles.\\nOne of its goals is to develop by 2004 a proto-\\ntype of an affordable family vehicle that gets up\\nto 80 miles to a gallon.\\n\\nThat partnership spawned various indus-\\ntry alliances that have produced a number of\\npromising solutions. Commercializing them\\nremains the next step. Today's advanced diesel\\nengine is one such practical step.\\n\\nBut work remains to be done on diesel’s\\nemissions. That’s an area where Mobil and\\nFord are partnering to develop the fuel, engine\\nand after-treatment technologies that the diesel\\nsystem will need to achieve both its efficiency\\nand emission targets.\\n\\nDeveloping tomorrow's affordable,\\ncleaner and more efficient family vehicles is\\na balancing act. Conflicting demands from\\nthe U.S. government don’t help. While the\\nTransportation and Energy departments\\nare pressing for the fuel-economy benefits\\nthat diesel can provide, the Environmental\\nProtection Agency has proposed aggressive\\nemission targets for 2004 for light-duty diesel-\\npowered vehicles.\\n\\nNone of the doors to tomorrow's vehicles\\nshould be closed prematurely. Regardless of\\nwhich engine-and-fuel combination emerges\\nas the best, the motorist should be the real\\nking of the road.\\n\\naE\\nMobil The energy\\n\\nwww. mobil om\\n\\nto make a difference.\\n\\n©1999 Mot Corporation\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

But paradoxi-\\nCally, the research on the\\ndeep ocean has proven to\\nbe central to research on\\nthe atmosphere and the\\nissue of climate change.\\n\\nFor the past 49 years,\\nscientists from the Bermu-\\nda Biological Station for Re-\\nsearch (BBSR) have made\\nbiweekly voyages to a site\\nknown as Hydrostation “S,”\\nwhich is 15 nautical miles\\nsoutheast of Bermuda. They\\nhave kept records of salinity,\\ntemperature, dissolved oxygen and nutrients at\\ndepths up to 2,600 meters. It is now the\\nlongest-running, Continuous year-round data-\\nCollection program for any one point in the open\\nocean. This data allows scientists to track and\\nunderstand the ocean\\'s response to changes in\\nthe atmosphere.\\n\\nIn 1988, BBSR started an expanded pro-\\ngram, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study\\n(BATS). Together, BATS and Hydrostation\\n\"S,\" both funded by the National Science\\nFoundation, have become international models\\nfor other integrated ocean-observation pro-\\ngrams.\\n\\nOne key finding is the pattern of natural\\nvariability of ocean temperature, with cooling\\n\\ning\\nFe\\n\\ncobra\\n\\n@ 7“ 19, |\\n\\n \\n\\nBBSR *\\n\\n1903\\n‘The Bennuda Biological Station for Research\\n\\nand warming cycles ranging from years to\\ndecades. Moreover, with time-series records, ,\\nscientists have now observed that some of the\\nyear-to-year variability in the Sargasso Sea\\necosystem is linked to variability in the larger-\\nscale climate system (e.g., El Nifio).\\n\\nMassive leaps in technology and com-\\nmunications over the past five decades have\\nalso allowed BBSR to share data quickly with\\nscientists around the\\nworld. Arid frequent deep-\\nocean research cruises un-\\ndertaken by BBSR have\\nproved to be an essential\\neducational tool for under-\\ngraduate and graduate\\nstudents specializing in\\nocean and climate re-\\nsearch.\\n\\nIn 1998, BBSR be-\\ngan a new initiative.

It will be conducted in partnership\\nwith ProNaturaleza, a Peruvian environmental\\norganization. Mobil’s support of The Nature\\nConservancy dates to 1976 and has included\\ndonations of environmentally sensitive lands in\\nTexas, Florida, Virginia and California.\\n\\nOur grant to Conservation International —\\nwill help fund a feasibility study of tropical-\\nforest preservation in Aceh, Indonesia, a -\\nprovince on the island of Sumatra. Conserva-\\ntion International seeks to enhance protection\\nof the remaining rain forests with community- .\\nbased conservation and utilization of natural .\\nresources. In recent years, Mobil has worked |\\nwith Cl to evaluate and monitor the ecological\\nand.social effects of oil exploration in the rain\\nforests of southeastern Peru.\\n\\nWhile these initiatives are modest, they\\nrepresent a wia-win step and address a poten-\\ntial problem that could require a global long-\\nterm solution.

However, weather and climate\\nare not the same — climate is far more com-\\nplex.\\n\\nWhile we all know what weather is, most\\nOf us are less clear about climate. A region's cli-\\nmate is defined as the prevailing behavior of its\\nweather, including variability.\\nSeveral decades of weather\\nmust ordinarily be con-\\nsidered to establish the\\naverage conditions and vari-\\nability of climate.\\n\\nThus, the recent re-\\ncord cold weather in the\\nNortheast U.S. does not indicate a cooling cli-\\nTate, just as last year's record summer heat in\\nEurope does not confirm a warming world.\\n\\nGeological evidence indicates that\\nEarth’s climate hds varied continuously, warm-\\ning and cooling due to changes on and beyond\\nEarth. Factors as diverse as variations in sun-\\nlight and Earth's magnetic field, asteroid im-\\npacts, Sun-Moon-Earth orbital interactions,\\ncosmic ray fluxes, continental drift, fluctuations\\nin $ea level, volcanic eruptions, changes in the\\nbiosphere, and massive ebbs and flows of con-\\ntinental glaciers, have significantly influenced\\nclimate.\\n\\n \\n\\nChanges in one feature can affect others.\\nDuring recent ice ages, another factor, green-\\nhouse gas concentrations, changed for rea-\\nSons that remain unclear. Evidence suggests\\nthat shifts in the flow of dust and nutrients from\\nlands to oceans may have significantly altered\\nthe exchange of carbon dioxide between\\n\\n \\n\\nChanges in one\\nfeature can affect\\nothers the\\n\\nthe air and oceans.\\n\\nObservations and theory both indicate\\nthat weather and important aspects of climate,\\nfor instance E! Nino events, behave in a chaotic\\nfashion that may never allow for definitive, long-\\nterm predictions. These and other fluctuations\\n\\n- Produce significant natural climate variability,\\n\\nFor example, over the past thousand years his-\\ntorical accounts and scientific data show evi-\\ndence of a Medieval Warm\\nPeriod followed by a Little\\nIce Age.\\n\\nin the face of natural\\nvariability and complexity,\\nconsequences of\\nchange in any single factor,\\nfor exampie greenhouse\\ngases, cannot readily be isolated and predic-\\ntion becomes difficult. Geological and historical\\nrecords make clear the need to account for\\nnatural climate variability and the integrated re-\\nsponse of the sntire climate system.\\n\\nOver the last few decades climate re-\\nsearch has made great progress. !n particular,\\nresearch has highlighted the risks to society\\nand ecosystems resulting from the buildup of\\ngreenhouse gases. At the same time, scientific\\nuncertainties continue to limit our ability to\\nMake objective, quantitative determinations re-\\ngarding the human role in recent climate\\nchange or the degree and consequences of fu-\\nture change.\\n\\nThis reinforces the view that, as countries\\nand societies work to find acceptable ap-\\nproaches to address climate change while con-\\ntinuing to promote global prosperity, there is an\\nongoing need to support scientific research to\\ninform decisions and guide policies.\\n\\nExxonMobil\\n\\nTaking on the world’s toughest energy challenges?\\n\\nVisit exxenmobi.com\\n\\n4. *\\n\\n4\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

At\\nstake is a complex issue with many\\n—— questions. Some things we know for\\ncertain. Others are far from certain.\\n\\nFirst, we know greenhouse gases account\\nfor less than one percent of Earth's atmosphere.\\nThe ability of these gases to trap heat and warm\\nEarth is an important part of the climate system\\nbecause it makes our planet habit-\\nable. Greenhouse gases consist\\nlargely of water vapor, with\\nsmaller amounts of carbon\\ndioxide (COz), methane\\nand nitrous oxide and\\ntraces of chlorofluoro-\\ncarbons (CFCs).\\n\\nThe focus of con-\\ncern is CO:;, While\\nmost of the CO, emit-\\nted by far is the result\\nof natural phenomena—\\nnamely respiration and\\ndecomposition, most attention\\nhas centered on the three to four\\npercent related to human activities— burning of\\nfossil fuels, deforestation. The amount of carbon\\ndioxide in the atmosphere has risen in the last 100\\nyears, leading scientists to conclude that the\\nincrease is a result of man-made activities.\\n\\nAlthough the linkage between the green-\\nhouse gases and global warming is one factor,\\nother variables could be much more important\\nin the climate system than emissions produced\\nby man.\\n\\nThe UN-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel\\non Climate Change (IPCC) thought it had found\\nthe magic bullet when it concluded that the one-\\ndegree Fahrenheit rise in global temperatures Over\\n\\n     \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n \\n\\nCarbon Dioxide Emissions\\n\\nHuman Activities 3%-4% _\\n\\nthe past century may bear a “fingerprint” of\\nhuman activity.

Whatever effect increased concentrations\\nof man-made gases may have, it will develop\\nslowly over decades. Thus, there is time for scien-\\ntists to refine their understanding of the climate\\nsystem, while governments, industry and the pub-\\nlic work to find practical means to Control green-\\nhouse gases, if such measures are called for.\\nAdopting quick-fix measures at this point could\\npose grave economic risks for the world.\\n\\n \\n\\nan\\nMobil The energy\\n\\nof\\n\\nhttp://www. mobil.com/clmatechange\\n\\nto make a difference.\\n\\n©1997 Moni Comporatbeor\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

By contrast, climate in the 10,000\\nyears since the last lce Age has been assumed\\nto be quite stable and serene, an assumption\\nthat is crumbling in the face of ever more sophis-\\nticated measurements. It now appears that the\\nclimate in this period has actually been quite\\nvolatile, changing Earth in ways that may dwarf\\nthe impact of human activity and complicate pre-\\ndicting climate trends. Nevertheless, the human\\nfactor in global climate change and the chance\\nthat we might be headed for damaging social\\nand economic dislocations cannot be ignored. In\\nthe second of three reports on global climate\\nchange, we look at efforts to achieve an ecologi-\\ncal balance.\\n\\nThe evolving science of climate change and\\nthe known behavior of greenhouse gases in the\\natmosphere—their long life and global, cumnula-\\ntive buildup—argue for a careful and comprehen-\\nsive approach to their control. Unfortunately,\\npolicy decisions now being considered in United\\nNations climate change negotiations could lead\\nto premature, inequitable and ultimately counter-\\nproductive measures. At stake are trillions of dol-\\nlars in technological and industrial changes,\\npotentially disruptive trade wars and an unprece-\\ndented transfer of weaith.\\n\\nA critical factor is timing. The compressed\\ntimetable of these negotiations tends to create an\\nunwarranted sense of crisis. A gradual approach\\n—one that would not result in an appreciable\\nbuildup of gases over the next 100 years—would\\nallow us to improve our understanding of the\\npotential threat and to develop more efficient\\ntechnology to deal with it. The U.N. Framework\\nConvention on Climate Change itself recognizes\\nthe dynamic nature of greenhouse-gas decision-\\nmaking. It requires periodic review “in tight of the\\nbest available scientific information on climate\\nchange and its impacts, as well as relevant tech-\\n\\nVith climate change,\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nnical, social and economic information.” .\\n\\nThere is great pressure to assign responsi-\\nbility for the stabilization and reduction of emis-\\nsions, along with the cost, almost entirely to the\\nindustrialized world. While the developing world\\nwould be spared the initial burden, such selective\\ncontrols would penalize all nations in the long run.\\n\\nimposing controls only on the industrialized\\nworld would likely cause what economists call “car-\\nbon leakage”—the transfer of energy-intensive\\nindustries to less-regulated countries, where they\\nwould offset the benefits of emission reductions.\\nBeyond this, the cost of mitigation, even for the\\nwealthiest nations, would weaken their purchasing\\npower and lead to a reduction in imports from the\\ndeveloping countries depriving them of a pow-\\nerful impetus for growth and prosperity.\\n\\nThe U.N. climate control negotiations rely\\non an arbitrary classification of countries as either\\ndeveloped or emerging. While much of the world\\nfalls short of a decent standard of living—nearly\\n2 billion people have never seen a light bulb,\\nand half of them rely on wood or other biomass\\nfor fuel—the developing world as now defined\\nincludes a growing list of commercial power-\\nhouses. Among developed countries, patterns of\\nenergy use are so diverse that an equal percent-\\nage reduction in emissions by all would be both\\nunfair and uneconomical.\\n\\nindependent studies—by the Australian\\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade as well\\nas the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\n(MIT) — increasingly point to international cooper-\\nation and worldwide implementation of control\\nmeasures as sensible and cost-effective. Such\\nan approach would include funding and technol-\\nogy for emission controls to flow from developed\\ncountries to the rest of the world, in return for\\ncredits for their own mitigation measures. A co-\\noperative, international approach, we believe, of-\\nfers a win-win for ail nations. ;\\n\\nNext:...we're all in this together.\\n\\nMobil\\n\\nhtp://www.mobil.com\\n\\nhe v\\n\\n©1696 Mobi!

It also promised to evaluate\\nthe economics of that policy and measure its\\nimpact. Those resuits are important because the\\nproposals submitted by other countries thus\\nfar would be disruptive and costly to the U.S.\\neconomy.\\n\\nYet, when the results from its own eco-\\nnomic models were finally generated, the admin-\\nistration started distancing itself from the findings\\nand models that produced them. The administra-\\ntion’s top economic advisor said that economic\\nmodels can’t provide a “definitive answer” on the\\nimpact of controlling emissions. The effort, she\\nsaid, was “futile.” At best, the models can only\\nprovide a “range of potential impacts.”\\n\\nFrankly, we're puzzled. The White House\\nhas promised to lay the economic facts before\\nthe public. Yet, the administration's top advisor\\nsaid such an analysis won’t be based on models\\nand it will “preclude...detailed numbers.” If you\\ndon't provide numbers and don't rely on models,\\nwhat kind of rigorous economic examination can\\nCongress and the public expect?\\n\\nWe're also puzzied by ambivalence over\\nmodels. The administration downplays the utility\\nof economic models to forecast cost impacts\\n10-15 years from now, yet its negotiators accept\\nas gospel the 50-—100-year predictions of giobal\\nwarming that have been generated by climate\\nmodels—many of which have been criticized as\\nseriously flawed.\\n\\nThe second study, conducted by Argonne\\nNational Laboratory under a contract with\\nthe Energy Department, examined what would\\n\\n \\n\\nhappen if the U.S. had to commit to higher\\nenergy prices under the emission reduction\\n\\nplans that several nations had advanced last\\n\\nyear. Such increases, the report concluded,\\nwould result in “significant reductions in output\\nand employment” in six industries—aluminum,\\ncement, chemical, paper and pulp, petroteum\\nrefining and steel.\\n\\nHit hardest, the study noted, would be the\\nchemical industry, with estimates that up to 30\\npercent of U.S. chemical manufacturing capacity\\nwould move offshore to developing countries.\\nJob losses could amount to some 200,000 in\\nthat industry, with another 100,000 in the steel\\nsector. And despite the substantial loss of U.S.\\n\\njobs and manufacturing capacity, the net emis- -\\n\\nsion reduction could be insignificant since de-\\nveloping countries will not be bound by the\\nemission targets of a global warming treaty.\\n\\nDownplaying Argonne’s findings, the’\\n\\nEnergy Department noted that the study used\\noutdated energy prices (mid-1996), didn't reflect\\nthe gains that would come from international\\nemissions trading and failed to factor in the\\nbenefits of accelerated developments in energy\\nefficiency and low-carbon technologies.\\n\\nWhat it failed to mention is just what these\\nnew technologies are and when we can expect\\ntheir benefits to kick in. As far emissions trading,\\nmany economists have theorized about the role\\nthey could play in reducing emissions, but few\\nhave grappled with the practicality of implement-\\ning and policing such a scheme.\\n\\nWe applaud the goals the U.S. wants to\\nachieve in these upcoming negotiations—namely,\\nthat a final agreement must be “flexible, cost-\\neffective, realistic, achievable and ultimately\\nglobal in scope.” But until we see the details of\\nthe administration's policy, we are concerned that\\nplans are being developed in the absence of\\nrigorous economic analysis.

Second,\\nthe emission-reduction policies being con-\\nsidered carry with them very large economic\\nrisks. Objectives and actions to deal with\\nclimate change can only be determined as\\nadditional knowledge is gained and uncertain-\\nties minimized. Nations should commit them-\\nselves to meaningful actions, including:\\n\\n  \\n\\nwhile harnessing free markets and voluntary\\nmeasures to deliver optimum emission reduc-\\ntions while preserving sustained economic\\ngrowth.\\nw To address the scientific uncertainty, govern-\\nments, universities and industry should form\\nglobal research partnerships to fill in the Knowl-\\nedge gap, with the goal of achieving a consen-\\nsus view on critical issues within a defined time\\nframe.\\nw During the fact-finding period, governments\\nshould encourage and promote voluntary\\nactions by industry and citizens that reduce\\nemissions and use energy wisely. Govern-\\nments can do much to raise public awareness\\nof the importance of energy conservation.\\nMobil is already participating in such\\nefforts. Through cooperative endeavors, we are\\nfunding research on technologies that promise\\ngreater energy savings or lower greenhouse\\ngas emissions. We are continuing to create\\nenergy-saving products, reducing our own\\nemissions and undertaking forestation projects\\nto remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\\nIn proposing these recommendations,\\nwe ask the Kyoto delegates to avoid mandates\\nbased on uncertain science and to resist\\nagreements that could inflict great economic\\npain. Take steps to curtail emissions, develop\\nmore energy-efficient technologies and im-\\nprove scientific understanding: These are the\\nchallenges nations should lay before their citi-\\nzens.

EIA examined six emission re-\\n\\nmag\\n\\nsat\\n\\nwMy\\n\\naleyy\\nmaul\\netl\\n\\nduction scenarios and concluded that as 7\"\\n\\nhigher energy costs work their way through the |\\n\\neconomy, the annual loss in GDP could range\\n\\nfrom $150 billion to $400 billion. That trans- .\\nlates to an annual cost of $1,500 to $4,000 .«:\\n\\nper family.\\n\\nThe Administration’s Council of Eco- \"|\\n\\nnomic Advisors (CEA) estimates the annual\\nGDP penalty at $7 billion—$12 billion, or a cost\\nper household of $70-$110. Why this rosy pic-\\nture? Because the CEA is counting on the U.S.\\n\\nbeing able to meet most of its target by relying ¢ .\\n\\non a global emissions trading system. Yet, the\\n\\nKyoto Protocol limits emissions trading to the -\\n\\ndeveloped countries.\\n\\nWhile emerging economies probably offer\\nopportunities to reduce emissions at lower\\ncosts than in the U.S., some nations like China\\nand India have said they are unwilling to par-\\nticipate in such schemes.\\n\\nJust 15 months ago, the U.S. Senate\\nvoiced its concerns over ratifying a treaty that\\nwould cause serious harm to the U.S. econ-\\nomy or that did not include participation by\\ndeveloping nations. Those concerns still have\\nnot been satisfied.\\n\\nThis week, negotiators are meeting in\\nBuenos Aires to discuss the complex rules to\\nimplement the Kyoto Agreement. Emissions\\ntrading is certain to be on the agenda. Serious\\ndifferences already exist on the percentage of\\nreductions that should come from domestic\\nactions rather than trading. The U.S. would\\nargue for no restrictions; the European Union\\nwants at least 50 percent of the reductions to\\ncome from domestic steps.\\n\\nWhile complex mechanics continue to be\\nworked, the fatal flaws of the Protocol—man-\\ndated emissions targets, selective participation\\nand economic distorntions—still persist.\\n\\nan\\nMobil The energy\\n\\nnitp //wwwy.mobil.com “\\n\\nto make a difference.\\n\\n« YOM Motor Corporation *\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Does it not\\nstrike anyone as curious that you can get an\\nenvironmental vote on legislation dealing with\\nglobal warming and then flip-flop to the other\\nside of the issue and get another gold star for\\nsupporting moratoria to put the gas reserves\\nof this country out of reach?\\n\\n“In the North Atlantic planning area, we\\nare talking about over 2.54 trillion cubic feet of\\nnatural gas. Thatis the equivalent of over 450\\nmillion barrels of oil. But no—let us not develop\\nthe gas. Let us simply import the oil in tankers\\nthat ply the coast of Maine, Massachusetts,\\nConnecticut, Rhode Island, and New York.\\nBesides, when there is a tanker spill, we can\\nall blame the administration for its recovery\\nresponse. .\\n\\n“We already have a’ moratorium in this\\nlegislation off New Jersey. The mid-Atlantic\\nplanning area has an estimate of 5.35 trillion\\ncubic feet of natural gas. That is over 950 mil-\\nlion barrels of oil equivalent. But many who\\ngive speeches on global warming do not want\\nus to develop the natural gas reserves off\\ntheir shores which could mitigate the effects\\n\\nof global warming....\\n\\n“And to my friends who want to buy\\nback producing leases off the coast of Flor-\\nida, | would ask, ‘Where do we get the petro-\\nchemical feedstocks to manufacture those\\never-popular mouse ears?’\\n\\n“Mr. President, at some point there has\\nto be an end to the environmental game of\\npolitical gamesmanship. if we are ever to get\\nserious about our energy dependency and\\nour legitimate environmental concerns, then\\nwe need to look to our natural gas reserves.\\nSenators simply cannot come to the floor and\\ndemand that we convert the federal fleet to\\nnatural gas and at the same time oppose\\nonshore and offshore production of natural gas.\\n\\n“At some point the so-called environ-\\nmental community has to come forward with\\nsomething positive. They hate hydro, they\\ndespise OCS, they get apoplectic over\\nANWR, they denounce coal, and they\\nbecome catatonic about nuclear. They are\\nappalled that we could wind up in a war in the\\nMideast which they made almost inescap-\\nable. All you need do is look around the Cham-\\nber and count the votes.\\n\\n“Think of the hypocrisy. Some of my col-\\nleagues argue against offshore drilling\\nbecause they believe offshore drilling is more\\ndangerous than onshore drilling and because\\na majority of the voters in their states don't\\nwant it. :\\n\\n“Yet in November, many of these same\\ncolleagues voted against cloture on S.1220\\nbecause of ANWR, which was onshore and\\nhad the support of a majority of the citizens of\\nAlaska.\\n\\n“Against the war, against OCS, against\\nANWR, against nuclear, against hydro.

Although climate has varied throughout\\nEarth's history from natural causes, today there\\nis a lively debate about the timing and magnitude\\nof the climate's response to the presence of\\nmore greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\\n\\nWhile that debate continues, we should\\nconsider now how to develop technology op-\\ntions that have much-lower emissions of green-\\nhouse materials (e.g., carbon dioxide, methane\\nand black soot). Supplying the energy required\\nby both well-established and developing soci-\\neties while at the same time reducing green-\\nhouse emissions will be one of the grand\\nchallenges that we humans must face in this\\ncentury.\\n\\nMeeting this challenge will require financial\\nresources and the engagement of the best\\nminds we can find.\\n\\nsa,\\nGCEP\\n\\n \\n\\nOne of the\\ngrand challenges\\nhumans face\\n\\n \\n\\nWe can imagine many potential technol-\\nogy paths that have lower greenhouse emis-\\nsions.

Here again,\\nits potential must be tempered with realism. For\\nexample, we use solar panels for supplemen-\\ntary water heating at our office building in\\nFairfax, Virginia, but providing for all of the site\\'s\\ncomparatively modest power needs would re-\\nquire over 300 acres of solar panels.\\n\\nThough renewables are promising, it is\\nimportant to keep the size of their contribution\\nand their current limitations in perspective.

Although CO,\\nemissions from developed and developing\\ncountries are about equal today, the push for\\neconomic growth will lead to a doubling of\\nemissions from developing countries over the\\nnext 30 years. In the meantime, emissions\\nfrom developed countries will begin to level off.\\n\\ng in the transportation sector, global\\nCOs, emissions will continue to grow, even as\\ndeveloped countries rapidly integrate advanced\\nfuel-efficient technologies. Developed coun-\\ntries could push vehicle emissions back to\\n1990 levels by 2020, but it would require an\\nunprecedented rate of transition to a hybrid\\nand fuel ceil fleet.\\n\\nm@ Similarly, in the electric power sector,\\ngrowing demand will boost CO. emissions\\neven with rapid implementation of highly\\nefficient generating technology. Renewable\\nforms of energy could play a role, but they\\nhave limitations that make them impractical\\nor expensive for most applications. Solar, with\\na cost breakthrough, along with CO, capture\\nand storage, offers the greatest potential in\\nthis sector.\\n\\n  \\n\\ng in the residential/commercia!l and\\nindustrial sectors, once again the rise in CO,\\nemissions is inevitable because of economic\\ngrowth. Cogeneration offers the best opportu-\\nnities to reduce emissions in these sectors.\\n\\nLonger-Term (To 2100). Reasonable\\nforecasts suggest that by 2100 CO, emissions\\ncould quadruple, which would almost double\\ntoday’s concentration of CO, in the atmosphere.\\n\\nIf stabilization of CO, concentration inthe\\n\\natmosphere were to become a policy objec-\\ntive, it would take a concerted effort, requiring:\\n\\ngi Great strides in increased energy °'\\n\\nefficiency, implementation of advanced tech-\\nnology, a switch to renewable energy and low-\\ncarbon fuels, additional investment in nuclear\\npower and capture and storage of CO,.\\n\\n@ Unprecedented global participation and\\nmanagement of the world’s energy resources.\\n\\nClearly, stabilization could be achieved\\nonly at considerable cost. It’s also clear that\\ndoing too much too soon, before new tech-\\nnology is proven and available, would add to\\nthe cost.\\n\\nGlobal economic models suggest that\\nthere is a penalty for haste. The world has time\\nto determine whether stabilization is neces-\\nsary. It also needs the time to develop the\\nmost promising technologies and to apply\\nthem globally— in every sector, in every nation.\\nThat’s the only way we can reap the full poten-\\ntial of advanced technology.\\n\\nFor a copy of Climate: Technology and Carbon Dioxide\\nEmissions—A Global Review and Assessment, visit our\\nWeb site at www.mobil.com/climate.\\n\\n \\n\\nea\\nMobil The energy\\n\\nwww.mobil.com\\n\\nsth’\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

But imposing a solution before\\nthe problem has been defined could prove a\\nrude awakening for the developed and develop-\\ning countries.\\n\\nBasically, three proposals are under consid-\\neration. The European Union pian wants industri-\\nalized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions\\n15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. Japan's\\nplan calls for reducing emissions five percent\\nbelow 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. The\\nU.S. plan targets a return to 1990 emissions lev-\\nels over the 2008-2012 period, with additional\\ncuts coming later.\\n\\nThe U.S. plan also encourages joint imple-\\nmentation projects— where one country invests\\nin an emission-reduction project in another coun-\\ntry and earns credit for the reductions at home—\\nand emissions trading. More importantly, the\\nU.S. plan recognizes that developing countries,\\nwhich will become tomorrow's largest carbon\\nemitters, must participate in the solution. The\\npresident said the U.S. will not “assume binding\\nobligations unless key developing nations mean-\\ningfuily participate in this effort.” The problem is\\nthat if they aren't signatories and participants to\\na treaty that binds them to action, then there’s no\\nglobal solution.\\n\\nEnergy conservation and development\\nof energy-efficient technologies in the U.S. via\\ntax cuts and other incentives are also under\\nconsideration.\\n\\nAt first reading, the U.S. proposal seems\\nmoderate. We're encouraged by the cail for\\nvoluntary, market-based steps. But we're wary\\nof incentives, which are usually subsidies in\\ndisguise.\\n\\nWhat is not moderate is the call to lower\\nemissions to 1990 levels. A cutback of that size\\nwould inflict considerable economic pain,\\n\\nmonth to decide on a mandatory.\\n\\nThe Energy Information Agency projects\\nthat energy demand in industrialized nations over\\nthe 1990-2010 period will grow about 30 per-\\ncent, Committing to binding targets and time-\\ntables now will alter today’s lifestyles and\\ntomorrow’s living standards.

And could businesses and\\nconsumers cut their energy consumption by 30\\npercent without some form of tax or carbon\\nrationing? Probably not.\\n\\nLet's face it: The science of climate change is\\ntoo uncertain to mandate a plan of action that\\ncould plunge economies into turmoil. Yet, that’s\\nwhat nations seem prepared to do.\\n\\nScientists cannot precict with certainty if\\ntemperatures will increase, by how much and\\nwhere changes will occur. We still don’t know\\nwhat role man-made greenhouse gases might\\nplay in warming the planet.\\n\\nWe're not impugning the existing science\\nor suggesting that “our science is better than\\nyour science.” Current science isn’t bad; it just\\ndoesn’t go far enough. Better science is emerg-\\ning on what factors affect global warming. No\\nneed to wait 20 or 50 years; big breakthroughs\\nthat will dramatically inform our decision-making\\nare expected in the next five to 10 years.\\nScientists are getting more precise in calculating\\ntemperature variations; they’re probing the role of\\nclouds and oceans on climate.

It's called the\\nNational Assessment Synthesis Report. Such\\nan assessment would be of great value to poli-\\ncymakers and the public if it were possible to\\nproduce an accurate one But as climate scien-\\ntists will tell you, we currently have neither the\\nknowledge nor the tools to\\ndo that.\\n\\nThe report bases many\\nof tts conclusions on two cli-\\nmate models developed in\\nCanada and the United\\nKingdom Climate models are\\nevolving research tools but\\nare not yet capable of pre-\\ndicting Earth's global climate and are currently\\nunsuitable for making national or regional as-\\nsessments. Professor Freeman J. Dyson of\\nPnnceton’s Institute for Advanced Study said it\\nbest at the March 1999 American Physical\\nSociety Centennial Meeting. “[T]he climate\\nmodels on which so much effort is expended\\nare unreliable....[W]e must continue to warn the\\npoliticians and the public, don't believe the\\nnumbers just because they come out of a su-\\npercomputer.”\\n\\nToday's global models simply don't work\\nat the regional level. For example, one of the re-\\nport models says the Great Lakes' water level\\nwill be five feet /ower; the other says It will be\\none foot higher. One model says most of the\\ncountry will be wetter, the other says rt will be\\ndner. Even apparent agreement between the\\n\\n \\n\\nClimate models\\nare currently\\nunsuitable for\\n\\nmaking nationai\\nassessiments.\\n\\nmodels in some places does not mean they are\\naccurate.\\n\\nThe overview report was released even\\nthough most of the underlying reports and\\nanalyses are not yet available for scientific peer\\nreview or public comment. Important cautions\\nand caveats from academic authorities are\\nburied in detailed language that makes it easy\\nfor key scientific uncertainties to be missed and\\nfor conclusions to be misun-\\nderstood or misrepresented.\\n\\nSo why base the report\\non unreliable models, and\\nwhy release it now? The re-\\nport's language and logic\\nappear designed to empha-\\nsize selective results to con-\\nvince people that climate\\nchange will adversely impact their Ives In re-\\nleasing this report, the administration seeks to\\ngain support for its own policies, which could\\ndamage the economy and employment while\\naccomplishing little in addressing potential\\nlong-term climate risks The report is written as\\na political document, not an objective summary\\nof the underlying science.\\n\\nChmate change 1s an important public\\nissue. That is why we support emphasis on fur-\\nther climate research, the development and en-\\ncouragement of promising technology, the\\npromotion of more efficient use of energy, the\\nremoval of barners to innovation, and cost-ben-\\nefit assessments of proposed policies.\\n\\nSound science and policy are at the core\\nof this approach, which should never become\\nthe horse behind anyone's political cart.\\n\\nExonMobil\\n\\nwww exxon mobil com\\n\\n© 2000 Exxon Mobi!

Yet, an action plan with\\nbinding commitments on developed nations\\ncould take shape by year's end.\\n\\nWe are concerned that policy makers are\\nnot considering the implications of controlling\\nCO, emissions. Studies have examined some of\\nthe emission-centrol plans tabled to date and\\nconcluded that they will impose painful burdens\\non developed economies, particularly if timeta-\\nbles are short and targets unrealistic. For Amer-\\nicans, such solutions mean jobs will disappear\\nand lifestyles will be pinched as our industrial\\ninfrastructure shrinks.\\n\\nA study just issued by Charles River\\nAssociates (CRA) provides additional weight to\\nthe impact of emission controls in an age of\\nglobal markets. The report shows how ill-timed or\\nill-considered abatement measures could stunt\\nworld economic growth, unsettle global trading\\n\\n| patterns and set the stage for a new era of trade\\nprotectionism.\\n\\nCRA analyzed two abatement scenarios —\\none a more modest stabilization proposal, the\\nother a more aggressive reduction plan. Both\\npolicies appear to fall within the boundaries of\\naccéptability by the U.S. government. The\\nauthors utilized a carbon-rationing plan to\\nachieve required reductions in CO, emissions. In\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nhttp:/Awww.mobil.com\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nlisten\\nieap\\n\\npractice, rationing will increase energy prices for\\nboth industry and the consumer.\\n\\nThe cost of limiting emissions could range\\nfrom $200 to $580 per ton of carbon, depending\\non the timing and severity of the plan selected.\\nTo put this in perspective, this equates to an\\nadditional cost to consumers of 50 cents to\\n$1.50 per gallon of gasoline in today’s dollars.\\n\\nThe expected blow to U.S. prosperity\\nwould be considerable, according to CRA: an\\nannual drop in gross domestic product ranging\\nfrom $105 billion in the year 2010 to $460 billion\\nin 2030, both in today's dollars. At the lower\\nrange, this works out to a loss in annual house-\\nhold income of roughly $1,000.\\n\\nOne key finding of CRAs study is that the\\neconomic burden of emissions controls is borne\\nnot only by the industrialized countries, but also\\nby developing societies, who under current pro-\\nposals need do nothing. The developed world\\nfeels the pain as it is forced to switch fuels and\\nrevamp its industrial infrastructure. The develop-\\ning world, which now exports GO to 75 percent of\\nits products to industrialized countries, will see\\nthose markets shrivel as economic growth stalls\\nand demand for protectionist measures grows.\\nDeveloping countries that import energy will ben-\\nefit from lower fossil-fuel prices, but in most\\ncases that gain won't offset the loss of trading\\nmarkets. And energy exporters— be they devel-\\noped or developing — will be particularly hard hit\\nas energy markets shrink.\\n\\nThe CRA study injects a healthy dose of real-\\nism into the climate-change debate. In the coming\\nmonths, we'll continue to look at what other\\nexperts are saying. Meanwhile, we urge interna-\\ntional policy makers not to make 1997 a year of\\nhasty decisions.

Under the United\\nNations Framework Convention on Climate\\nChange, countries are pressing for the stabiii-\\nzation, and eventua! reduction, of man-made\\ngreenhouse-gas emissions. Nations are gathered\\nthis month in Geneva for the Second Conference\\nof Parties meeting. Negotiations wilt culminate\\nlate next year and could result in legally binding\\ntargets, timetables and common measures to\\nreduce greenhouse-gas emissions.

We are presenting this editorial series in the\\nhope that it will help contribute to a rational and\\nproductive discussion on global climate change.\\n\\nThe greenhouse effect is a natural phenom-\\nenon. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere\\nand warms Earth's surface. Radiant heat is emit-\\nted back to the atmosphere; some of it is ab-\\nsorbed by greenhouse gases—-water vapor,\\ncarbon dioxide (CO.) and methane— and reemit-\\nted back to Earth, causing further warming. This\\nheat trapping is known as the greenhouse\\neffect—an occurrence that makes our planet\\nhabitable. Naturally occurring greenhouse gases\\n— predominantly water vapor— account for 95 to\\n97 percent of the current effect. The other 3 to 5\\npercent is attributable to man’s activities. Aj-\\nthough CO; is the predominant emissions con-\\ntributor, methane, in the short term, has 25 times\\n\\nthe effect of CO2.\\n\\nWorldwide, the burning of fossil fuels cou-\\npled with massive deforestation yields some 20\\nbillion metric tons of COz annually. About half\\nthese emissions wind up in the atmosphere. The\\nrest is believed to be absorbed by increased\\nplant growth and the oceans. We know little\\nabout this nonatmospheric absorption, which\\ncomplicates decision-making. For example, how\\nmight plant growth and absorption by the ocean\\nchange with higher global temperatures? More-\\nover, greenhouse-gas emissions, which have a\\nwarming effect, are offset by another combustion\\nproduct—particulates—which leads to cooling.\\n\\nOne thing we do know is that greenhouse\\ngases reside in the atmosphere for long periods\\nof time and are dispersed over the entire globe.\\nThat means their potential impact on climate\\nshould be viewed cumulatively rather than on the\\noutput from any one country or in any one year.\\nThe concentration of greenhouse gases is build-\\ning up slowly—less than 0.5 percent annually for\\nCO,—and that gives us time to implement effec-\\ntive mitigation measures.\\n\\nThe industrialized countries and the\\ndeveloping world contribute about equally to pre-\\nsent-day CO:2 emissions, but the pattern is shift-\\ning rapidly, as the peoples of Africa, Asia and\\nLatin America seek to better their lives. The devel-\\noping nations argue that the industrialized world\\nhas no right to impose its environmental rules on\\nthem, possibly short-circuiting their industrial rev-\\nolution, without compensation or dispensations.\\n\\nThis raises thorny social and economic is-\\nsues. A number of the scientists believe we have\\nthe time and the resources to avert a crisis.\\nPolicy makers would be wise to amend the\\nmaxim, “think globally, act locally,” and put the\\nemphasis on global action.\\n\\nNext:... what we don’t know can hurt us.\\n\\nMobil\\n\\nhttp:/Avwww.mobil.com\\n\\n©1996 Mobi Corporation\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

If developed nations act alone to reduce\\nemissions, the staggering cost imposed on en-\\nergy-intensive industries will drive nations to ex-\\nport much of their industrial base to countries\\nwith less stringent controls.\\n\\nWorld economic health will suffer as nations\\nare forced to switch from fossil fuels, saddled\\nwith large carbon taxes and driven to prema-\\nturely scrap many factories and machinery. The\\ndislocations will be even more severe if the solu-\\ntions are not implemented globally.\\n\\nThis does not mean we shouid hope for the\\nbest and do nothing.

Oil is cleaner than coal and natural gas is\\ncleaner than both. More utilities worldwide are\\nswitching to natural gas, which emits only half\\nthe CO, as does coal per kilowatt hour pro-\\nduced. Other energy sources—solar, nuclear\\nand wind— emit virtually no gases, yet often face\\nserious economic and political obstacles.\\n\\nConstructive steps that involve participation\\n\\n“by all nations and flexible timing should be con-\\n\\nsidered now. Efforts should be directed at stabi-\\nlizing and reducing emissions when and where\\nthey are most cost effective. For example, one\\ncontrol scenario being discussed — stabilizing\\nCO, emissions today and implementing a 20 per-\\ncent reduction in industrialized countries starting\\nin 2010—could cost $2.6 trillion. Spreading the\\nresponsibility globally—allowing trading of emis-\\nsion credits—would lower the cost to some $1.1\\ntrillion; adding flexibility in timing— allowing cu-\\nmulative rather than annual emission targets out\\nto the year 2050—would bring total costs down\\nto $0.5 trillion. Some studies indicate the flexible\\nroute could achieve the same long-term benefits\\nas the “quicker” plan.\\n\\nAs negotiators grapple with these issues,\\nthey would do well to heed the U.N.’s preliminary\\nguidelines: “Measures to deal with climate\\nchange should be cost-effective so as to ensure\\nglobal benefits at the lowest possible cost.” Jobs\\nand livelihoods are at stake. Current and future\\ngenerations are counting on us to manage the\\nchallenge wisely.\\n\\nWe intend to follow up on the results of the\\nJury conference in Geneva to look at the eco-\\n\\nnomic impact that emission reduction proposals\\n\\ncould have on nations.

Perhaps that is because the Appeal urged\\nSummit attendees to avoid making important\\nenvironmental decisions based on “pseudo-\\nscientific arguments or false and non-relevant\\ndata.”\\n\\nThe Heidelberg Appeal was issued initially\\nby some 264 scientists from around the world,\\nincluding 52 Nobel Prize winners. Today, the\\nAppeal carries the signatures of more than\\n2,300 scientists — 65 of thern Nobel Prize win-\\nners—from 79 countries. If nothing else, its mes-\\nsage is illustrative of what's wrong with so much\\nof the global warming rhetoric. The lack of solid\\nscientific data.\\n\\nScientists can agree on ceriain facts per-\\ntaining to global warming. First, the greenhouse\\neffect is a natural phenomenon; it accounts for\\nthe moderate temperature that makes our\\nplanet habitable. Second, the concentration of\\ngreenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide) has\\nincreased and there has been a slight increase in\\ngloba! temperatures over the past century.\\nFinally, if present trends continue, carbon diox-\\nide levels will double over the next 50 to 100\\nyears.\\nControversy arises when trying to link past\\nchanges in temperatures to increased concen-\\n\\ncalypse no\\n\\ntrations of greenhouse gases. And it arises\\nagain when climate prediction models are used\\nto conclude Earth's temperature will climb dras-\\ntically in the next century and—based on such\\nmodels—to propose policy decisions that could\\ndrastically affect the economy.\\n\\n_ According to Arizona State University\\nclimatologist Dr. Robert C. Bailing in his book,\\nThe Heated Debate (San Francisco: Pacific\\nResearch Institute for Public Policy, 1992), until\\nknowledge of the interplay between oceans and\\nthe atmosphere improves, “model predictions\\nmust be treated with considerable caution.”\\nMoreover, models don't simulate the complexity\\nof clouds, nor do they deal adequately with sea\\nice, snow or changes in intensity of the sun's\\nenergy.\\n\\nAnd they don’t stand up to reality testing.\\nComparing actual temperatures over the last\\n100 years against model cafculations, the mod-\\nels predicted temperature increases higher than\\nthose that actually occurred. Moreover, most of\\nthe earth's temperature increase over the last\\ncentury occurred before 1940. Yet, the real build-\\nup in man-made CO, didn't occur until after\\n1940. Temperatures actually fell between 1940\\nand 1970.\\n\\nSifting through such data, Dr. Balling has\\nconcluded, “there is a large amount of empirical\\nevidence suggesting that the apocalyptic vision\\nis in error and that the highly touted greenhouse\\ndisaster is most improbable.”\\n\\nOther scientists have an even more inter-\\nesting viewpoint. Notes atmospheric physicist\\nS. Fred Singer, president of the Washington,\\nD.C.-based Science & Environmental Policy\\nProject, “the net impact [of a modest warming]\\nmay well be beneficial.”\\n\\nAll of which would seem to suggest that\\nthe jury's still out on whether drastic steps to\\ncurb CO, emissions are needed. it would seem\\nthat the phenomenon-- and its impact on the\\neconomy— are important enough to warrant\\nconsiderably more research before proposing\\nactions we may later regret.\\n\\nPerhaps the sky Isn't falling, after all.\\n\\nMobil\\n\\n© 1933 Mobs Corporation\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

We assess energy efficiencies and\\nthe total carbon dioxide emissions of various\\ntechnologies from the production of the energy\\nthrough to final consumer use. In doing so, we\\n“level the playing field” in order to understand\\nthe full cost and environmental impact of ve-\\nhicle fuel production and use.\\n\\nFor example, hydrogen-powered\\nfuel-cell cars are commonly hailed as being\\nemissions-free and having much better\\nfuel econamy than today’s vehicles.\\nAlthough this is true for the vehicles, it\\n\\n_ fails to consider the energy require-\\nments and the carbon dioxide gener-\\nated for the production and\\ndistrioution of hydrogen. :\\n\\nThe most economical way to\\nproduce hydrogen — from natural gas\\n— generates significantly more\\ncarbon dioxide than does the\\nproduction of gasoline, is less\\nenergy-efficient and yields a\\nfue! that is costlier and more ~\\ndifficult to store and transport.\\n\\nMaking hydrogen from the elec-\\ntrolysis of water is energy-intensive. and if today’s\\nmix of U.S. electricity were used, well-to-wheels\\ncarbon dioxide emissions would actually be\\nhigher than those for today's gasoline-powered\\ncars. The cost of the fuel would also quadruple.\\n\\nUsing solar power for electricity could elim-\\ninate the carbon dioxide emissions but would\\nraise fuel costs even more.\\n\\nIn contrast, producing, transporting, refining\\nand delivering petroleum fuels are efficient\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n\\nprocesses. More than four-fifths of the original\\nenergy in crude oil is delivered to your cars.\\nHowever, the vehicles themselves are relatively in-\\nefficient. Less than 20 percent of the energy in\\ngasoline ultimately moves your vehicle. The rest is\\nlost to exhaust heat and mechanical friction.\\nThough diesels, which are common in\\nEurope, are slightly more efficient and emit\\nless carbon dioxide than gasoline cars, they\\nalso have higher emissions of particu-\\nlates and smog-causing nitrogen oxides\\nand have difficulty meeting U.S. tailpipe\\nstandards.\\nGasoline/electric and diesel/electric\\nhybrid vehicles show promise.

And the buildup is a concern to some\\nbecause of the role that it may play in global\\nclimate change. Policy-makers are talking\\nabout the goal of stabilizing atmospheric CO,\\nconcentrations— getting to a point where the\\nconcentrations stop increasing.\\n\\nOur study shows this simply cannot be\\ndone short-term, but as part of our assess-\\nment we considered what might be accom-\\nplished over a longer term-——to 2100— if\\nstrong measures are called for. Using the\\nwidely respected Global Energy Model devel-\\noped by Battelle, we examined two potential\\ntargets that are often discussed by policy-\\nmakers. What would it take to stabilize CO,\\nconcentrations at twice the preindustrial level?\\nAnd what would it take for stabilization at twice\\ntoday’s level?\\n\\nThe tougher goal—stabilization at twice\\npreindustrial levels—would mean reducing\\nglobal CO, emissions by almost 75 percent\\nbeyond what they would be with ongoing\\nimprovements in energy efficiency. The goal\\n\\n \\n\\ncould be reached only if all countries partici-\\npate by conserving energy, switching to lower-\\ncarbon fuels, using more renewables, investing\\nin nuclear energy and implementing CO, cap-\\nture and storage.

Globally, electric gen-\\n\\nat “Se Last week, we saw that, for the fore-\\n\\nseeable future, energy use will\\n\\nZa\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nincrease in tandem with world eco-\\nnomic growth. With fossil fuels\\npowering much of that climb, CO,\\nemissions will also increase. Continuing our\\nassessment, we now look at the various sectors of\\nthe economy to see what role advanged technol-\\nogy could play in reducing CO, emissions by 2030.\\n\\nCan technology make a difference? The\\nanswer is, “it depends.”\\n\\nFor developed countries, it can. Their econ-\\nomies are mature and their populations are largely\\nstabilized, so investing in energy efficiency can\\nhalt the growth in CO, emissions. In developing\\ncountries, capital is scarcer, other needs are more\\npressing and growth in fuel use far outstrips the\\nimpact of normal efficiency gains.\\n\\nLet's see what is possible:\\n\\nTransportation: The technology for\\ntomorrow's passenger vehicles is in various\\nstages of development. Advanced diesel engines\\nare the closest to market. While hybrid and fuel-\\ncell vehicles may take longer to become com-\\nmercially viable, both promise to markedly\\nreduce CO, emissions. But the long life of pas-\\nsenger vehicles (12-15 years on average) and the\\ntime required for new technology to dominate the\\nautomotive fleet mean that a big change is not\\naround the corner.\\n\\nlf the U.S., Western Europe and Japan\\nrapidly adopted these new vehicle technologies,\\nautomotive CO, emissions there could be sub-\\nstantially below their 1990 level by 2030.\\n\\nHowever, carbon dioxide from transporta-\\ntion will more than double by 2030, driven largely\\nby an increase in the number of vehicles in devel-\\noping countries and continued growth in other\\ntransportation modes— aviation, shipping and\\ntrucking. So even with all these improvements,\\nglobal transportation emissions would be\\nreduced only by about seven percent from that\\nprojected for 2030.\\n\\neration is projected to triple over the next 30 years\\nand associated CO, emissions will more than\\ndouble. If developed countries moved to more ©\\nefficient plants and switched to lower-carbon fuels\\n(natural gas), they could cut their projected CO,\\nemissions by as much as 40 percent in this time |\\nframe. Again, growth in the rest of the world will -\\nfar surpass this reduction.\\n\\nRenewables can be a factor. Biomass and\\nwind are nearing cost competitiveness with new\\npower generators, but they have inherent capac-\\nity limitations. Solar’s role could be larger if tech-\\nnological breakthroughs drive down its current\\nhigh costs. Another promising alternative is the ..\\ncapture of CO. produced by fossil fuel power °\\nplants and its storage permanently underground\\nin depleted oil and gas reservoirs.\\n\\nIndustrial: This sector is generally energy-\\nefficient, but advanced technology (more efficient\\nboilers, motors, etc.) and greater use of cogenera-\\ntion could slow emissions growth. Cogeneration\\nutilizes waste heat from power generation for\\nother purposes, such as heating.\\n\\nResidential/commercial: Upgrading and\\nretrofitting homes/buildings can improve energy\\nefficiency. But gains here over the next 30 years\\nare limited by the slow rate of building turnover (50\\nto 100 years) and the high cost of energy-saving\\ntechnologies.\\n\\nWhat can be gained? Advanced technology\\nwidely implemented by developed nations can cut -\\nglobal emissions by eight million tons from a pro-\\njected 45 billion tons annually in 2030. The sheer\\ngrowth— more than doubling—in emissions that\\nwill occur in the rest of the world simply over-\\nwhelms these reductions.\\n\\nNext week we'll look beyond 2030.\\n\\nFor a copy of Climate: Technology and Carbon Dioxide\\nEmissions—A Global Review and Assessment, please\\ncall 1-800-293-5796.\\n\\nom\\nMobil The energy\\n\\nwww.mopbil.com\\n\\n‘\\n\\nto make a difference..\\n\\n©1999 Mobi Corporation\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

A21\\n\\nPeopie who live in greenhouses...\\n\\nEarth may be seen as a greenhouse that receives\\nheat from the sun, radiates some back into\\nspace, and traps enough in the atmosphere to\\nmaintain a livable climate. Without this trapped\\nheat the earth would be 60 degrees cooler and,\\nto say the least, a far tess livable home.\\n\\nThere's some possibility the temperature in\\nour greenhouse is rising—and that certain gases\\nassociated with industrial activity and population\\ngrowth may now be trapping more of the sun's\\nenergy than has been the case in the past. This\\nphenomenon has been called the greenhouse\\neffect. What should be done about it—and when\\nand by whom—is now under discussion by\\nindustry, science, and government all around\\nthe world.\\n\\nGlobal temperatures seem to be increasing.\\nOver the last hundred years, the annual average\\nis up by one degree Fahrenheit, with the warmest\\nyears coming recently, in the ‘80s. There's new\\nevidence to suggest the oceans are getting both\\nwarmer and slightly higher than they had been.\\nScientists do not agree on the cause and signifi-\\ncance of these changes—but many believe\\nthere's reason for concern about levels of “green-\\nhouse gases” in earth's atmosphere.\\n\\nMost of that atmosphere—over 99 percent—\\nis made up of oxygen and nitrogen, which don't\\ntrap radiant heat. But certain trace gases do, and\\nof these the major four—dubbed the greenhouse\\ngases—are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous\\noxide, and the man-made chemicals known as\\nthe CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons.\\n\\nCarbon dioxide is the most abundant of\\nthese trace gases in the atmosphere, but rela-\\ntively the weakest in its heat-trapping attributes.\\nits concentration has been rising, primarily from\\nthe increased worldwide combustion of fossil\\nfuels over the last 150 years or so, but also in part\\nfrom deforestation. Scientists estimate that car-\\nbon dioxide causes about 50 percent of any\\ngreenhouse effect.\\n\\nMethane is estimated to produce about 17\\npercent of that effect. A small part of this\\nmethane comes from the use or production of\\nfossil fuels. But most of it is either from decom-\\nposing organic matter—like animal wastes and\\nwood—or from natural or agricultural processes\\non the land, in peat bogs, swamps, and rice pad-\\n\\ndies, for example.\\n\\nAnother 17 percent of the greenhouse\\neffect—but this is the portion increasing fastest—\\nis said to be caused by the CFCs. These manu-\\nfactured chemicals, used in refrigeration, aero-\\nsols, and industrial solvents, are already\\nrestricted internationally because they were said\\nto be destroying earth's protective upper-atmo-\\nsphere ozone layer. The search for substitutes is\\nin progress, and it’s a safe guess that CFC pro-\\nduction and use will eventually be eliminated.\\n(Mobil makes no use of CFCs in its products.)\\n\\nNitrous oxide, which accounts for perhaps\\nsix percent of the greenhouse effect, comes into\\nthe atmosphere mainly from soil processes act-\\ning on nitrogen fertilizers, with a small amount\\nproduced in fue! combustion.\\n\\nThe principal focus in discussions about\\ncontrol of the greenhouse effect is on carbon\\ndioxide and the CFCs. The fatter are already\\n\\n‘ being phased out by international agreement—\\n\\nwhich leaves reduction of carbon dioxide emis-\\nsions at center stage.\\n\\nThe global climate is so huge and various\\nthat no easy formulas—or easy answers—apply.\\nNor do we fully understand the role of the oceans\\nin absorbing and releasing carbon dioxide from\\nand into the atmosphere. While much research\\nremains to be done, we're already seeing world-\\nwide pressure to reduce the atmospheric build-\\nup of carbon dioxide. For this, there seem to\\nbe only two practical options: conservation in\\nthe use of fossil fuels, and vigorous develop-\\nment of alternative energy sources—those with\\nless carbon, like natural gas, and those without\\ncarbon, such as nuclear power, solar, and\\nhydroelectricity.\\n\\nAll must be explored as we face up to the\\npossibility of global warming. Some public offi-\\ncials have targeted transportation fuels, but it's\\nwell to remember that in the whole world, high-\\nway vehicles account for only five percent of any\\nwarming trend. U.S. vehicles would account for\\nnot even half of this.\\n\\nMobil is very much aware that cleaner, more\\nefficient, and more carefully used fossil fuels will\\ncut the risk of global warming, and we're hard at\\nwork along all these fronts. We live in the green-\\nhouse too.\\n\\nNiobil\\n\\n©1989 Mobi! Corporation\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Since 1990, it has added up to $77 million in\\nenergy savings at Mobil facilities around the world.\\n\\nResults like these convinced us that finding\\nways to save energy is a good way to improve\\nboth the bottom line and the environment.\\n\\nIn March, the U.S: Environmental Protec-\\ntion Agency (EPA) named Mobil the “1998\\nENERGY StarR® Buildings Partner of the Year\" for\\n“overall excellence in the ENERGY STAR” Buildings\\nand Green Lights® Partnership.” The award rec-\\nognizes our longtime voluntary commitment to\\nreduce energy consumption. The EPA called\\nthese efforts “a remarkable example of how\\norganizations can combine environmental con-\\ncerns with smart business strategy.”\\n\\nWhile the ENERGY STaR® program was\\ndesigned initially to save energy by cutting elec-\\ntricity use, it also provides an added benefit —\\nreducing emissions of carbon dioxide. And that’s\\nimportant because of concerns about the poten-\\ntial impact of increasing greenhouse gases in the\\natmosphere.\\n\\nRight now, 18 percent of U.S. Fortune 500\\ncompanies participate in these federal energy-\\nefficiency partnerships. So do hundreds of non-\\nprofit organizations, federal, state and local\\ngovernments, universities and schoo! districts.\\nTheir combined voluntary efforts helped prevent\\nthe emission of 1.2 million metric tons of carbon\\nequivalent last year. That’s the same as eliminat-\\ning emissions from about one million cars or\\nplanting one million acres of trees.\\n\\nBy the year 2010, the EPA expects the\\nEnNercy Stan Buildings and Green Lights”\\nPartnership to reduce annual greenhouse gas\\nemissions by 24 million metric tons of carbon\\nequivalent: that\\'s nearly a 10 percent reduction in\\nprojected emissions from commercial buildings.\\n\\n \\n\\nSER\\n\\nHow did we begin? Our energy manage- |,\\n\\nment specialists began in 1990 to identify cost- .\\neffective and environmentally sound solutions by -\\n\\ntackling Mobil’s electricity consumption first.\\nThey installed more efficient lighting, tuned\\nup older buildings and focused on “right sizing”\\n\\nthe heating and cooling equipment to match our ..\\n\\nlower energy needs.\\n\\nSometimes, they found simple solutions,\\nlike installing sensors to turn lights on whenever\\nsomeone enters infrequently used spaces. Other\\ntimes, the team streamlined entire processes,\\nsuch as compressed air production or heat and\\nsteam systems.\\n\\nTheir efforts have escalated. Now, teams —\\n\\nare incorporating energy-wise design into all of\\n\\nMobil’s U.S. company-operated stations, includ- «\\n\\ning On The Run” sites. We hope to share these\\nenergy-saving steps with Mobil’s franchisee net-\\nwork across the nation. It\\'s the kind of voluntary\\n“can-do” that led to the EPA’s EnerGy STar®\\nBuildings award.\\n\\nWe\\'re proud to be a charter member of the\\nEPA\\'s program. Not only has it helped our bot-\\ntom line, it also contributes to our efforts to\\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. These steps\\ninclude installing energy-saving technology at\\nrefineries, reducing gas flaring in our offshore\\nproducing fields ard eliminating methane leaks.\\nIn the last three years, we\\'ve cut our carbon\\nemissions by more than one million metric tons\\nand will continue to look for further reductions.\\n\\nWhile Mobil is taking prudent, responsible\\nsteps now to voluntarily reduce our emissions and\\nthose of our customers, similar efforts by con-\\nsumers can help, too. Steps like choosing more\\nenergy-efficient appliances, upgrading homes to\\nmake them more fuel-efficient or combining\\nerrands when driving can make a difference.\\n\\nLet\\'s show a little voluntary “can do.” Wise\\nenergy management is everyone\\'s business.\\n\\nFor information on EPA\\'s ENerGy STAR* pro-\\ngram, contact: 1-888-STAR YES (1-888-782-7937).\\n\\naE:\\nNMiobil The energy\\n\\nhttp wwyemobd com ¥\\n\\nto make a difference.\\n\\n2 Oa Mop Cao bioratiit:\\n\\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
